Alfa Romeo,Giulia,"Alfa Romeo Giulia - good purchase? | It‚Äôs a 2019 and list price is $37,895 (live in Canada so this post is all in Canadian dollars - list price is about $27,750 USD).

Haven‚Äôt had a car in a few years due to living downtown in my city and not needing one, but now am looking to get something for convenience and to make it easier to visit my parents a few times a year who live 8ish hours away. I won‚Äôt drive it much (maybe 5,000 kms a year) but would be nice to have something fun and comfortable when I do. Used car market where I live is still crazy, mainly impacting the ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù cars, making the bridge between them and something like this smaller, so I‚Äôve started looking at some more luxurious type cars. I have an upfront $40k price limit so this fits (also comfortable with the maintenance costs - after calling the dealership $2.5k per service every 12,000 kms). My three issues:

1. I‚Äôve heard of Alfa Romeo but don‚Äôt know much about the reliability. I looked online and most reviews have said they are quite good as of recent years, however, there were also a couple that said the opposite. I want to avoid two trips a year to the dealership for ‚Äúunexpected‚Äù repairs.

2. I called the Alfa Romeo dealership (they are not the seller) and they noted the kms are high for a 2019. I had thought the opposite, as 60,000 kms (37,000 miles) seemed reasonable. Is this getting into a problematic range with this type of car?

3. Not many comparable‚Äôs online, so not sure if that price is reasonable or if I‚Äôm overpaying.

Alfa Romeo,Stelvio,"Alfa Romeo Stelvio??? | So, my old Land Rover Freelander its giving his last time so i passed the last month searching for suvs that i like and that could fit my taste and needs, comparing them, so i can replace the Land, and i came to the conclusion that i just love the Alfa Romeo Stelvio
I dont have in mind the idea of buying a new one because they are too exepensive, im considering buying a 2018/2019 model
But im affraid that the maintenance costs and repairs of Alfa Romeo are too expensive because i never had one and you dont see much in my country and that makes me think. 
Can someone tell me if they are indeed expensive or if what makes them expensive (in the case that they are expensive) is the fact that its a Stelvio?? Im in europe btw, Portugal
Thanks!
(Im accepting other suv recommendations, ive seen a lot tho) | Hi mate, great choice! 
The choice on an Alfa depends on the availability of dealers in your area. Ideally you have a couple in your direct area or at least 1/2 hours drive max. That helps you to avoid (in case of single dealership) being ripped of for maintenance. The Alfa‚Äôs Giulia‚Äôs and Stelvio‚Äôs are quite reliable in most parts but some things take a bit longer to change (e.g. Breaks are taking usually longer on alfa‚Äôs than other brands) which will affect the cost om it. Again, no well known issues that are expensive though. You can scroll this reddit page where multiple known cases are explained like original battery power are not powerful enough so replace it immediately if not replaced by previous owner. Like with any other car, check if the maintenance has been performed according to the maintenance schedule. What I hear/read on this forum is that we should buy 2020 or newer models as most small issues are fixed in these model years. Good luck and enjoy driving. No other SUV will drive like a Stelvio I can tell. I have driven many other (also premium) brands‚Ä¶

Audi,A1,"Audi A1 as a First car? | I‚Äôm close to my first attempt to pass the exam for driving license and I‚Äôm looking for some advice about first car. I‚Äôm 35 F and have around ¬£6k saved for a car. I really REALLY really would like Audi A1. Is it a good choice for 1st time driver? Thanks | It‚Äôs quite possible - the lowest group Audi A1 is the 1.2L TFSi one and if you get a lower spec it‚Äôs likely to hover around group 9 or above. Depending on your area and circumstances regarding insurance it‚Äôs possible. 

In all honesty though your first car does not need to be flashy in any sense, even though it‚Äôs nice to have a better or flashier car, it‚Äôs often best to have a car that‚Äôs cheap to drive, insure and repair given that you‚Äôre going to be prone to a mishap here and there. 

Saying that, as long as you know your insurance will be reasonable, you have researched the car you‚Äôre purchasing properly and have the funds to protect against any hiccups the car has after ownership, you should be absolutely fine. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend getting anything higher than the 1.2 or 1.4 however the price of your insurance will noticeably increase for not so much big a difference in driving performance.

Thinking of a new car - not going to happen yet but who doesn't love a browse on auto trader dreaming away.

Currently I drive an 07 civic 1.8 and it has never let me down and is nippy enough with pretty decent MPG as quoted 37 on the dash due to a mixture of a bit of motorway and some around town driving probably about 150-200 miles a week.

Now as everyone else can appreciate, the want for something a bit quicker is always there however I want to keep a decent MPG so I came across the S3's.

Now, what i want to know is what are the real MPG figures for a car like this? Auto trader is telling me 40mpg combined and that seems unrealistic for a just over 5 second 0-60 car.

Also what are the maintenance costs like on a car like this?

Are the motors actually any good or should I be expecting issues from the off?

Not looking at anything near new so would be something along the lines of - https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202308190968925?sort=price-asc&advertising-location=at_cars&exclude-writeoff-categories=on&fuel-consumption=OVER_40&make=Audi&maximum-mileage=80000&model=S3&postcode=Kt19%209nq&fromsra

Ideally id like a 4/5 door so this is just for reference.

Any other suggestions welcome for a decent performance/good mpg motorare welcome. Also should state needs to be ULEZ so diesels are pretty much off the table!

The car needs to be able to seat 2 kids in the back.

An Octavia VRS is not a bad looking car but I just don't think the performance is enough for what I am after. Edit - this could be a sensible.option

Cheers chaps and chapettes! | Expect high 20s, low 30s mpg.

Schaue mir derzeit gebrauchte 216d und 218d GTs als Ersatz f√ºr meinen 2006 Touran 1.9 Tdi an (kleine Familie mit gro√üem Hund). Ich find ihn relativ cool f√ºr nen Pampersbomber und man sieht ihm die 10 Jahre seit Release kaum an weder innen noch au√üen. Es gibt eine ganze Reihe an Fahrzeugen in meiner Umgebung mit etwa 180.000 km Laufleistung innerhalb von 6-8 Jahren, Oft guter Pflegezuustand, √ñlwechselintervalle eingehalten, Rechnungen vorhanden, meist von der Vertragswerkstatt.

Preise vom H√§ndler je nach Ausstattung zw. 10k - 18k.

Ich w√ºrde das Ding gern noch mindestens 3 Jahre fahren. Ich fahre etwa 20.000 km im Jahr, wenig Stadtverkehr und regelm√§√üig zur Arbeit und zur√ºck in einem anderen Teil Deutschlands (400 km/Tour). Eher gem√ºtlich.

Budget max 14k.

Was sind eure Meinungen zum Fahrzeug?

Gern auch Alternativen aber Ich will keinen Kombi aus der Kompaktklasse a la Ceed SW oder Golf Variant einen seiner Br√ºder. Ich habe noch einen Ford im Furhpark und will keinen weiteren. Ich will auch keinen Touran 1TX mehr. Touran II finde ich kaum im Budget. | Kenne mich mit den Modernen BMW Motoren nicht so gut aus.

That said, it has a few issues. The biggest concern is rust on the body, mostly on the doors, along with a poor paint job. The undercarriage is still in decent shape. The car is driven only in dry weather during late spring/summer/early autumn.

Would it be reasonable to invest $6,000‚Äì$8,000 in rust repair and a full repaint? The shop I‚Äôm considering has good reviews and seems reputable. This money is about six months' worth of savings for me.

BMW,M2,"Completely let down by BMW M2 Competition | My close friend has a 2021 BMW M2 Comp (F87) that I‚Äôve driven a number of times in all situations from highway to back roads to autocross.

The way people talk about this car, you‚Äôd think it was the second coming of the Messiah mixed with the DNA of the original 2002, but I drive it and feel absolutely nothing. Am I missing something?

For reference, I drive a 996 Carrera and a BMW X3 35i daily. These are my complaints about the M2.

1) The steering is both hyperactively twitchy and completely numb. It tramlines and skitters around nervously without a clue as to what the front tires are doing. The steering wheel is also stupidly thick.

2) The manual gearbox is the worst I‚Äôve ever driven in a performance car. The clutch is feather light with zero feel, and the gearbox itself has long, mushy throws (a common BMW issue). Maybe better with the DCT.

3) The car bucks on upshifts and when letting off throttle (i.e. going into a corner). A fast 1-2 shift is very unsatisfying to me for this reason. 

Now, the car has a TON of front-end grip, a great diff and traction, amazing brakes, and is fast as hell. But I can‚Äôt love it because, in my opinion, the inputs are garbage. My friend asks me if he bought the wrong car, and, having driven Alfa Qv, CT4-V and Shelby GT350 which are miles more satisfying, I don‚Äôt know what to say. 

Am I crazy or is the M2 overrated? | I currently own a 991.2 GT3 in manual, and OWNED an f87 m2 comp prior. The m2 is fun enough that it isn't ""ruined"" for me by the GT3. 

My M2 was a DCT though. And yeah if you suddenly let off the throttle it's gonna jerk, because you're suddenly shifting the weight from the rear back to the front.

BMW,X7,"Regret buying the X7 | Bought my wife a brand new 2020 X7 and it's been nothing but trouble. Here's why:

1) It goes through tires every 10-12K miles and it's $3K all in to replace them. Dealer says its bc ""the car is heavy! And California roads are bad"".. plus o realize the staggered wheel setup prevent you from rotating the tires. I have a Porsche 911 S 992 with similar setup that isn't as bad as the x7. 

2)  Buggy software and control head unit. They clearly don't Q/A their code. Head unit had to be fully replaced. Censors are defective and car slams on its brakes almost every time my wife backs out of driveway when there's nothing there. They've changed the censors twice and it's made no difference. Same issue.

3) Dealer informed me that the Air suspension and rocker arms are basically falling apart and needing to be replaced within a few months of the warranty expiring.  I leaned later that they weren't engineered properly in the first few yrs or the. X7.. This work is >$12-15K. BMW may cover part of the costs on air suspension but the car only has 45K miles and has been used as a groceries and to cart kids around.

The main things I like is that it has a decent amount of power, it's rear wheel drive and it looks pretty good. Also any advice reliability wise would be great as I'm not very familiar with this engine. | That year 2.5L is a BMW N52 engine, here is what you need to know - https://bmwtuning.co/bmw-n52-engine-problems/ so yeah there are some things to look out for definitely but that also generally seems to be regarded as one of the more reliable engines BMW had at the time. BMW was going through a bit of a rough patch with new generations of engines and 4-cylinders then, so you have to do your research on which ones are best.

Citroen,Berlingo Multispace,"Citroen Berlingo Multispace (2007) - Isofix | Hi there,

We just bought a second-hand Berlingo Multispace 1.4L petrol, and we're unsure about isofix?

The person we bought it from didn't know, and we don't have any handbooks or anything.

Citroen,C Crosser,"Citroen c-crosser 2008 battery drain | I have a 2008 citroen c-crosser and for the past few months i keep having issues with battery even after replacing it. If its driven often its not an issue but if i leave it standing ( all off and locked) for 1-2 weeks battery is flat (3-5V). When I charge the battery and let it run for a while, shut if off and lock it, and try to measure the draw from battery (disconnect one of the leads and measure with multimeter) i am getting 0,8-1,2A which isnt much but i does drain the battery in a couple of days.  
Now my question is, is this power draw normal and the new battery is somehow bad?  
If its not, what should i look for to fix it (lights etc are all off)?  
I would preffer to give it a try miself and at least finding the issue even if i cant fix it myself before getting it over to a mechanic to try and save a bit on possibly long diagnosis.  
Thanks for any possible help/advice.  


  
 | Definitely not a normal amount of current. You have either a short circuit somewhere or some auxiliary device plugged in.

It would also be possible that the alternator is bad (diodes or controller burnt).

Might want to ask Mitsubishi guys, as the base car is one. Maybe there is something specific to this model that's a common issue.",,,,,,,
Citroen,C1,"Citroen C1 Issue after works - is garage at fault? | Hi all - looking for a bit of advice. To preface I know very little about cars.

Recently had a decent bit of work done by Halfords on my 2013 C1 including rear silencer and brake pipe pretty much completely replaced. This was about 3 months ago. Noticed this week that the brake pipe (?) is hanging super low and scraping on speed bumps. The car‚Äôs also growling a bit in acceleration in low gear.

There seems to be some sort of plastic/fabric clamp/strap that looks knackered? 2nd picture. Some fabric round the outside of it looks very frayed and I assume this is why it‚Äôs hanging low. I have no idea what this part is called.

Obviously will be taking back to Halfords ASAP, my question is this: is this part something that appears on the receipt/that they‚Äôve replaced? It was a big bill and obviously if it‚Äôs their error I‚Äôd want it fixed free - but not sure if this is something that‚Äôs on the list (3rd picture). Would be very grateful if anyone could advise. | As soon as I saw the word Halfords",,,,,,,

Citroen,C3 Aircross,"Citroen C3 Aircross Long Term Review | Background:
I've been driving cars for 12 years, and in our family, we've owned various models including the Maruti A-Star, Honda Amaze, Hyundai Creta, and Toyota Fortuner. I was looking for a car with a punchy engine, spacious cabin, good ride quality, and great value for money. During the 2023 year-end discount, I purchased the top model of the Citro√´n C3 Aircross for 12.2 lakh INR with a BH number plate.

Driving Experience: 
After covering over 7000 kilometers, I can say that the Aircross is a no-nonsense car. It offers an excellent engine, great driving dynamics, and one of the best suspensions in its class. While it is functionally well-equipped, there are a few areas that could use improvement.

Pros:
Engine: The engine is a fun to drive one, delivers adequate power with 195 Nm of torque at a very low RPM (1750). This provides a strong boost from the lower range. It never feels underpowered, even on highways, effortlessly cruising at speeds above 120 km/h.

Driving Dynamics: The steering is moderately heavy, which offers good feedback in city traffic, and it becomes more substantial at higher speeds on highways. Compared to the Creta, the body roll is significantly contained.

Suspension: Having driven vehicles like the Fortuner, Creta, Taigun, Kushaq, Nexon, and Harrier, I felt that the suspension setup in this car is a class apart. It‚Äôs arguably the best in its segment and even surpasses some cars above its class. Potholes are barely noticeable, and small speed breakers are smoothly absorbed, thanks to the 17-inch alloy wheels.

Space: At 6 feet tall, I find the interior space quite generous. The boot capacity is also impressive at 511L which is better than most cars in its segment.

Features: The top model comes equipped with a 10-inch touchscreen featuring wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The screen is responsive and has worked flawlessly so far. The reverse camera provides decent night visibility. The sound system, consisting of 4 speakers and 2 tweeters, delivers good bass without cracking at high volumes..

Conclusion:

Now that the new updated 2024 Aircross and Basalt has scored a 4 star rating in BNAP, without ADAS, Aircross should be a well rounded choice for someone with a budget of 14 lacs and wants a bigger car with fun to drive engine | Do you miss any of the features like cruise control or start button? Are the door handles an issue?",,,,,,,

Citroen,C4,"Is Citroen C4 PureTech 130 EAT8 a good car? | Hi all. I‚Äôm considering to buy used 2022 Citroen C4 PureTech 130 EAT8 in very good condition. It‚Äôs comfortable and spacious.

Citroen,C5,"Citroen C5 project and questions | A friend of mine is planning on getting a small suv and I want to go on some off-road adventures with him. I already have a car however and I don't think I need another, so I have decided to build on my car's strengths to make a reversible Safari build.

1. the lift: this car has Citroen's famous hydropneumatic suspension. I don't believe there's a way to lift it other than with the suspension settings. This isn't too much of an issue, as the lift on the high driving position (up to 40kms/h for rough roads) is actually quite generous.

2. Tires: I do not want to cut the bumpers or anything like this, I want to be able to sell the car in the future. Right now I am wearing 195/65 r15, and I think that 205/70 r15 A/T will give me some more ground clearance and puncture resistance. I wonder if I could get away with 195/80 r15 without rubbing, but I doubt it.

3. Skid plate: bolt on skid plates for my model are less than 150‚Ç¨ so no brainer

4. Roof rack: there are bolt points on the roof, so I will fabricate a roof rack (I have access to every tool and machine one could desire)

5. roof tent: I ain't buying, I will make a foldable plywood platform for the roof rack and put a conventional tent on there

I will also get a manual winch, and all my camping gear, cooking gear, fridge and tools fit in the truck 

My questions: 

do you think I could get away with the bigger tires without rubbing or chassis modification?

Do you think there is an easy way to raise this car since it straight up doesn't have coil springs?

Do you think I will wreck it going on mild off-road adventures?

Citroen,Grand C4 Picasso,"C4 Grand Picasso replacement injector | Suddenly lost all power on Sunday and managed to limp home. The RAC guy said he thought it was the injector and got me to the local garage who have provided the quote in the picture. 

It's cheaper than the local Citroen dealer who quoted ¬£1500 but they did say injectors tend not to fail in isolation suggesting one or more of the other 3 may fail soon. 

I'm a bit concerned by the bit that essentially says ""spend ¬£1200 and then we'll see if it has actually fixed it"" suggesting I could end up having to pay way more than that! 

Any idea if this is a reasonable price and what my other options might be? (wishful thinking I'm assuming)  | Rip iff thats the price to replace all 4 labour included",,,,,,,
Citroen,Grand C4 SpaceTourer,"2019 Citroen Grand C4 Spacetourer 1.5L BlueHDI - Engine oil turned to sludge 'after 2 months' | **Query: Could the engine oil turn in to this sludge after only 2 months of trips mostly consisting of 20 minute trips probably not exceeding 50mph?**

Hi all. We bought this car late November from a dealership, and have had no end to the issues with it, starting half way back when it started coming up with service warnings regarding the AdBlue and emissions fault. On our 5th trip to our garage in 6 weeks we got the below image from them and explanation that the engine oil was just sludge.

We brought this up with the dealership and they said that it is likely that because we don't drive the car for long trips frequently, then this will have caused the engine oil to turn in to this sludge as the engine isn't getting to the right temperatures often and from condensation forming. For context, we've done 5-6 1-1.5 hour trips in the last 2 months but 90% is 20 minute trips to work and back. Could this be a possibility, or is it likely that the car was never serviced in the first place?

Citroen,Multispace,"Citroen Berlingo Multispace (2007) - Isofix | Hi there,

We just bought a second-hand Berlingo Multispace 1.4L petrol, and we're unsure about isofix?

Dacia,Sandero,"Sandero dacia thoughts? | I'm looking at a new car. I'm currently driving an 09 3dr fiesta. Drives well but I want something with cruise control, android auto and will generally last me for a good 10-13 years.


I do low mileage mostly (under 10k) as I work from home. 

The sandero seems to fit the bill without being too pricey (cash purchase).

I've tried one today and I like it. I'm even considering going for the crossover version for the extra space given I'm 6foot3.

Does anyone have any experience with these cars? And any words on the petrol or bi-fuel models? | > I'm even considering going for the crossover version for the extra space given I'm 6foot3.

Is the Stepway more spacious inside? I thought it just offered higher ground clearance. (I do prefer the looks of the Stepway, though)

&nbsp;

> Does anyone have any experience with these cars?

My ex-boss has had three Dacias in a row (one Duster, then two Logans), and he does about 50k/year. Buys new, takes it to 150-200k miles, then trades it in for another. I seem to remember he had a bit of trouble with one of them, but nothing too catastrophic. Certainly didn't put him off buying another.

Also, one of my current colleagues has a 64(?)-plate Duster, and I was very surprised how solid it felt inside. Perfectly fine, not low-rent at all. A Duster and a Sandero Stepway were both on my buying shortlist last year before I went for a Honda Civic, and after my first-hand experience with that Duster they'll both be on my next buying shortlist as well. (Hopefully not for 3-4 years though...)

&nbsp;

> And any words on the petrol or bi-fuel models?

Bi-fuel cars are much more common on the continent, including Poland and Italy where Dacia is a popular brand. It's a very mature technology over there, and at about 80p/litre for LPG right now, certainly worth considering.

&nbsp;

-----

Given the ridiculous prices for new cars nowadays -- fancy a [1-litre Audi A1 for almost ¬£32k?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb22boNDEV0) -- I think a Sandero's a great purchase. And I believe 60% of Dacia buyers are repeat customers^[[source](https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/why-dacia-reworking-its-winning-sales-strategy)] which is a sign they're doing something right.",,,,,,,

Fiat,500,"Tried a fiat 500 yesterday, please don't buy one. | So starting off my it's one of my grandparents cars, it's a 2019 with 7000 miles on the clock in automatic form. Overall i have absolutely no idea why you'd buy one objectively, they look cute and are quite nice inside but the downsides are absolutely monumental.

First impressions, everything creaks when you touch it and the door cards look very very cheap, the infotainment system looks straight out of 2010. It's also way to small, i'm 6ft and my legs felt so crampt in the footwell, with no-where to put my left foot whilst driving. The rear seats and boot space where abysmal, tried to get someone behind me and it was just impossible without chopping their legs off.

Turn on the engine and it sounds decently refined vs the 3 cylinders of it's competitors, although apparently it gets worse MPG than my 2014 Volkswagen Up! by a fair margin. Trying to get it out of my grandparents tight driveway is a chore as the turning circle seems to be absolute crap, struggling with turns which my Up! and even Golf wouldn't have much difficulty with.

Out on the open road the handling feels fidgity and upredictable despite being on good tyres and in excellent mechanical condition. The visibility is good but not as good as in a Volkswagen Up!. Giving it a bit of gas and it feels unbelievable slow and the auto box is dim-witted as hell, despite the 500 having 2 more HP and a similar stated 0-60.

It was also tremendously uncomfortable and jolty over bumps, just an overall really bad car, i can see absolutely no appeal about them apart from the styling, the interior is built poorly, it drives poorly, it's not that manuevarable and is just completly outclassed by a hyundai i10, Kia picanto, Volkswagen Up! and probably even a C1, Aygo, 108. | You‚Äôre pretty happy with your VW Up! it seems",,,,,,,
Fiat,500X,"Is Fiat 500X a good first car? | 24 M here hoping to get my license by Spring next year. Starting to look at options for first car, family member has offered to sell their car, Fiat 500X, as they're in market for new car.
Offered to sell it for ¬£2-2.5k depending on what garage would take for parts, would be sold at around ¬£4-4.5k if I bought from garage myself.

My budget is around ¬£2.5k.

Having driven it a couple of times the general handling of it seems fine and felt comfortable in it, just slightly apprehensive of whether parking would be a lot harder in a larger first vehicle or if l'd get used to it? And if upkeep costs would be affordable.

Any suggestions welcome :) | In general it‚Äôs not a car I‚Äôd specifically recommend, however if you‚Äôre being offered it for ¬£2-2.5k like you say then I would jump at the chance if I were in your position- you have little to lose at that price.

In terms of it being a larger vehicle, yeah you‚Äôll just get used to it- all the techniques you‚Äôve learnt in smaller cars still apply it can just be harder to judge the car‚Äôs extremities, it‚Äôll have parking sensors so I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much.",,,,,,,

Fiat,Idea,"Act 3 is absolute hell for anyone with ADHD/Autism | Don't get me wrong, I'm still enjoying this game a ton, but I feel like it's been such a struggle to get through act 3 because I keep having to take breaks due to sensory overload haha. The constant chatter, the huge map, the numerous quests giving you choice paralysis, the LOUD ass sound the steel watchers make when they're about to explode, those annoying people that keep casting spells, the amount of constant talking and dialogue there is, etc etc. It's so jarring when I close the game out and there's suddenly deafening silence compared to the constant noise there is in the game.

To be clear I'm not complaining about the game itself, just wondering if anyone else feels like act 3 is a bit overwhelming.

Edit: If you're ND and feel differently about it that's totally fine, I'm just personally sensitive to noises

Edit again: I should have worded this as act 3 is hell for *me* with adhd, I wasn't trying to speak for everyone on the spectrum and I'm sorry for wording it poorly like that. I know not everyone with adhd has issues with noise sensitivity and I know this is an issue anyone can experience, this was more of a personal rant because act 3 was giving me anxiety and headaches | I am not diagnosed with ADHD/Autism but those casters in front of sorcerers sundries always inhibit my thinking process when I get there.",,,,,,,

De juiste keuze maken betekent effici√´nter werken, kosten besparen en klaar zijn voor de toekomst.¬†[Mobility Group Haaker](https://www.mgh.nl/), de¬†[**offici√´le Fiat Professional dealer**](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/)¬†**van**¬†[**Amsterdam**](https://www.mgh.nl/amsterdam/)**,**¬†[**Heemstede**](https://www.mgh.nl/heemstede/)¬†**en**¬†[**Hillegom**](https://www.mgh.nl/hillegom/)¬†**(Haarlemmermeer)**, helpt ondernemers al jarenlang bij het vinden van de juiste bedrijfswagen. Een model dat steeds vaker wordt gekozen door ondernemers is de¬†[**Fiat Scudo**](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/scudo/). Dit model biedt de perfecte balans tussen laadruimte, wendbaarheid en zuinigheid. In dit artikel leggen we uit waarom de¬†[Fiat Scudo](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/scudo/)¬†een uitstekende keuze is en hoe deze zich verhoudt tot andere¬†[modellen binnen Fiat Professional](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/modeloverzicht/).

# Fiat Scudo, betrouwbaarheid en flexibiliteit in √©√©n bedrijfswagen

De¬†[Fiat Scudo](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/scudo/)¬†is ontworpen voor ondernemers die een¬†[bedrijfswagen](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/)¬†nodig hebben die zowel ruim als wendbaar is. Of je nu in een drukke stad rijdt of lange afstanden aflegt, de¬†[Fiat Scudo](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/scudo/)¬†biedt een oplossing die past bij jouw bedrijfsbehoeften.

De¬†[Fiat Scudo](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/scudo/)¬†heeft een laadvolume tot 6,6 m¬≥, wat voldoende is voor de meeste kleine en middelgrote ondernemingen. Dankzij het slimme ontwerp is de laadvloer laag, waardoor laden en lossen eenvoudiger wordt. Bovendien biedt de¬†[Scudo](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/scudo/)¬†verschillende motoropties, waaronder een volledig elektrische versie, de¬†[E-Scudo](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/scudo/), die ideaal is voor ondernemers die hun ecologische voetafdruk willen verkleinen.

# Kostenbesparing met de Fiat Scudo

De kosten van een¬†[bedrijfswagen](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/)¬†bestaan niet alleen uit de aanschafprijs, maar ook uit verbruik, onderhoud en restwaarde. De¬†[Fiat Scudo](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/scudo/)¬†blinkt uit in lage gebruikskosten, dankzij effici√´nte diesel- en elektrische motoropties.

Fiat Professional heeft de Total¬†[Cost of Ownership (TCO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost_of_ownership)¬†van de¬†[Scudo](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/scudo/)¬†geoptimaliseerd, waardoor ondernemers minder kwijt zijn aan brandstof en onderhoud. Bovendien zijn er subsidies beschikbaar voor de elektrische versie, waarmee je direct kunt besparen op je investering.

**Vergelijking,**¬†De¬†[Fiat Scudo](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/scudo/)¬†biedt¬†**tot 30% lagere onderhoudskosten**¬†dan veel concurrenten in zijn klasse, zoals de Volkswagen Transporter en de Mercedes Vito.

# Elektrisch rijden met de Fiat E-Scudo

De¬†[**E-Scudo**](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/scudo/)¬†is de elektrische variant van de¬†[Fiat Scudo](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/scudo/)¬†en biedt een actieradius tot¬†**330 km**¬†op een volle accu. Dit maakt de bestelwagen geschikt voor stadsleveringen en regionale transporten.

Met de snellaadfunctie laad je de accu in¬†**45 minuten tot 80% op**, waardoor je nauwelijks stilstand hebt. Daarnaast komen ondernemers in aanmerking voor¬†**MIA/Vamil subsidies**, waardoor elektrisch rijden financieel aantrekkelijk wordt. In steeds meer steden worden dieselvoertuigen geweerd, wat de¬†[E-Scudo](https://www.mgh.nl/fiat-professional/scudo/)¬†een toekomstbestendige keuze maakt.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-kevin-hart-eli-roth-1235966400/) (30/100):

>It‚Äôs conceivable that longtime fans of the video game might get more out of¬†*Borderlands*, but I wouldn‚Äôt count on it. At one point, Claptrap returns to operational mode after a heavy-weaponry assault and says, ‚ÄúI blacked out. Did something important happen?‚Äù Not in this movie.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-eli-roth-1236098894/) (40/100):

>Marketed to look like a cross between ‚ÄúSuicide Squad‚Äù and a Zack Snyder movie, director¬†Eli Roth‚Äôs tamer-than-expected take on ‚ÄúBorderlands‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have half the attitude or style its cyberpunk ad campaign might suggest. But here‚Äôs the real reason why fans of the game will be disappointed: It‚Äôs predictable, therefore nullifying the whole ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôll it be?‚Äù appeal of loot.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1638717/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-cant-bring-video-game-movie-to-life/) (4/10):

>Borderlands makes a point of not being different enough to upset the fanbase, but it's also not unique enough to win over new audiences, either. It's a movie for everyone and no one, a film so unwilling to make a splash that it barely makes a peep.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-eli-roth-1235033545/) (42/100):

>If granted permission to bring his signature sadism to these infamously batshit characters, Roth could have delivered his ‚ÄúMad Max: Fury Road.‚Äù Instead, restricted by standards that seem equally unlikely to please preteens, he was left holding a bomb.

[Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/borderlands/) (2/5):

>A botched Guardians wannabe that isn‚Äôt half as fun as you‚Äôd hope from the punky sci-fi promise of its video-game source material and the presence of Blanchett at the top of the cast list.

[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-kevin-hart-jack-black) (3/10):

>Borderlands is a catastrophic disappointment that plays like hacked-to-pieces studio slop, betraying everything fans adore about Gearbox Software‚Äôs franchise in derivative, regrettable taste.

[Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-1235070586/):

>Borderlands Is an Insult to Gamers, Movie Lovers and Carbon-Based Lifeforms. We'd say it's the worst video game movie ever ‚Äî but that's way too limiting

[Collider](https://collider.com/borderlands-movie-review/) (5/10):

>'Borderlands' is a fun ride, but a bloated cast and breakneck pacing don‚Äôt allow it to reach its full potential.

[BleedingCool](https://bleedingcool.com/movies/borderlands-review-imax-action-karen/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter) (5/10):

>I don't think I have ever watched quite so gossamer-thin a movie and yet been so entertained throughout as with Borderlands. There really is nothing to this film. No emotional depths, stakes, or convoluted plot worth speaking of.

[TotalFilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/action-movies/borderlands-review/) (40/100):

>The Gearbox title gamers loved has spawned a frenetic and disorderly shambles they‚Äôre likelier to loathe. Claptrap? You said it.

[The NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/movies/borderlands-review.html) (40/100):

>You can see the jokes, but most of them don‚Äôt land. Still, there is some neat design work if you squint.

[GameSpot](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-movie-review-generic-and-disposable/1900-6418265/) (2/10):

>Borderlands comes in at a very brief 102 minutes in length, which you might be tempted to reflexively celebrate in our current landscape of hella long movies. But there's a reason longer movies are en vogue--more time allows for more depth, and depth is what Borderlands is missing the most. But that's what happens sometimes when a movie spends four years in post-production being repeatedly reworked--over time, everything gets sanded down into nothingness.

[ScreenRant](https://screenrant.com/borderlands-movie-review/) (70/100):

>Blanchett knows exactly what movie she's in, and she seems to be having the time of her life fitting herself into the mold of a video game heroine.

[Men's Journa](https://www.mensjournal.com/streaming/borderlands-review)l:

>If Borderlands doesn't stop studio executives from salivating at the sight of every single IP that comes across their desks, nothing will.

In Theaters August 8:

>Lilith, an infamous outlaw with a mysterious past, reluctantly returns to her home planet of Pandora to find the missing daughter of the universe's most powerful S.O.B., Atlas. Lilith forms an alliance with an unexpected team¬†‚Äî¬†Roland, a former elite mercenary, now desperate for redemption;¬†Tiny Tina, a feral teenage demolitionist;¬†Krieg, Tina's musclebound, rhetorically challenged protector;¬†Tannis, the scientist with a tenuous grip on sanity; and¬†Claptrap, a persistently wiseass robot. These unlikely heroes must battle alien monsters and dangerous bandits to find and protect the missing girl, who may hold the key to unimaginable power. The fate of the universe could be in their hands but they'll be fighting for something more: each other.

Thanks for all the useful advice and anecdotes so that being said, here's my situation. 

Looking at getting a 2016 Ford Edge Sport. I'm coming from a RAV4 that's had 93k trouble free miles. My buddies all think I'm crazy since I'm looking for a comfortable and dependable ride but this one seems too good to pass up.

Specs 
2016 Ford Edge Sport, 38k miles, 8 year 150k mile extended warranty (so expires 2024), Sync 3 upgraded to accommodate Carplay and Android, pano roof, heated/cooled front seats, adaptive cruise, self park, and pretty much every other bell and whistle offered for this year. Seller is offering it at low end of fair value by Kelley and is even willing to wait while I sell the RAV4 to offsite the final financed cost.

So should I pull the trigger and religiously change the fluids (ESPECIALLY the transfer case) or will the Edge be more of a headache in the long run. Looking at driving this for a year then gifting it to my mom since it has more safety features and driver aides tha. Her current car.

74 reg Ford Puma, brand new. 1.0 turbo. Drove it for work, it was a rental.

Got in and I couldn't believe how small it was inside. I was genuinely cramped inside. I'm only 6ft and I felt like I couldn't adjust the seat in any way where I wasn't hunched over.

Struggled to pull 40mpg on a dual carriageway when my old fiesta easily pushed 50+.

1st gear might as well be 5th, zero acceleration.

Was funny to throw around corners, was wobbling about everywhere and certainly did not feel planted.

The only positives were that it wasn't made of scratchy plastic. That's it. I'll give it that, the materials were actually quite nice. The screen was also surprisingly quick but I still prefer my Mazda's dials. (Seriously, why can modern Mazda still do buttons and dials but no one else can?)

Honda,CR-V,"Honda CR-V Buying Lessons Learned | I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I wanted to share my most recent car buying experience. I hope you can learn something from my experience about negotiating and what not to do for financing. For reference, I live in South Texas on the coast and purchased my vehicle on 11/13/23.

**Background**

My wife wanted a new and larger vehicle, especially since we're considering having kids. I did tons of research (including on this subreddit) and we landed on buying either a Hyundai Tucson or a Honda CR-V. We didn't like the Toyota RAV4 or the Kia Sportage. I wanted a hybrid vehicle based on estimated future cost of gas & estimating our future city vs. highway mileage. Ultimately we decided on Honda due to reliability concerns about the Hyundai. We liked the 2024 Honda CR-V Hybrid Sport-L trim due to the screen size & power liftgate vs. the Sport trim. 

**Negotiation**

I visited dealers, gave the whole spiel about ""just looking today,"" got contact info with local salesmen, and took home pricing info. The Sport-L was listed at $42k out the door. I contacted the salesman and was promised $38k on the Sport-L, but they only had a grey one. I decided to sleep on it.

My wife later shared that she preferred the Canyon River Blue Metallic. I sent out an inquiry to every dealership within \~250 miles of us asking if they could match or beat this price, and they all said that the dealership lied to us and that the price was too good. Disappointed, I contacted the original salesman who then offered a Sport Touring CR-V in the color she wanted for $39k out the door.

After thinking on it for a few hours, I contacted the dealership back and asked for $38k out the door on the Sport Touring ($40.8k MSRP). After being told a sob story about how they couldn't do it, I said I'd have to think more on it. Immediately, they said that if I came in that night, they would do the deal.

All said and done, we purchased a 2024 Honda CR-V Sport Touring Hybrid for $38k out the door (base price $35,360 with $2.2k sales tax and $400 in doc/title/inspection fees). I was ecstatic to say the least.

**Financing**

Here is where we made a mistake. Due to the rush nature and my inexperience in car buying, I totally forgot to get financing figured out. We knew we were going to finance part of the vehicle but put down \~$18k down payment. The dealership tried to get us to finance through a local credit union at 7.5% rate and said that it was the best they could do. When I challenged to see the paperwork, the loan officer came back and said she misread the terms and that financing through Honda would be slightly better. I thought we would qualify for Honda's special financing of 3.99% for 36 mo., but the dealership said the best Honda would do was 7.19%, despite 780+ credit score and DTI ratio of <15%, citing ""lack of installment loan history"" as her guess. Not sure if she was lying or not, but my loan is through Honda (American Honda Finance). We wound up taking the high interest loan due to me not being prepared and really having no other options. I wonder if I would have gotten the special financing rate if I had gotten pre-approval through Honda prior to purchasing the car.

My advice is to get pre-approved prior to car shopping. In our case, I didn't realize we would be purchasing so quickly, but we still should have gotten pre-approved and brought the financing with us.

Thanks for reading and feel free to add any other advice you may have for new buyers!

Honda,Civic,"I hate my Honda Civic | Traded in my 16 Forester (2.5i Limited) for a 2020 Civic (EX sedan) a few weeks ago.

I wanted a smaller, more fun to drive car. Drove a 23 corolla and liked the smoothness but found it boring. Drove a 19 Mazda3 and LOVED the look and interior but found the rotary dial interface weird and was worried it would be bouncy on rough roads. Confusing going from CVT to automatic. Insurance quote was more $ and mpg a bit worse. Then drove the Civic which felt like a marriage of the two and bought it on the spot.

Worried I rushed the process because my Forester was getting bad to drive without paying to fix. I feel I should have walked away to think it over. I'm afraid I didn't give the Mazda a fair shake, maybe should have tried camry, older lexus es, or Acura, something else I haven't thought of.... (considering these brands primarily because reliability is a top priority for me).

Things I like about the Civic:

* Nice smooth relatively powerful engine (1.5T)
* intuitive tech interface
* pretty good ACC and LKA although can be annoying in certain cases,
* cool weird shiny material they used in the dash
* cloth seats are made of quality cloth and look slick (leather can actually be annoying in the summer when I'm wearing shorts or a dress)
* leather wrapped tearing wheel, heated front seats, apple car play, passenger side blind spot camera
* Fuel economy
* relatively low insurance costs
* nice size, pretty good trunk space (I think I like the sealed trunk vs the open trunk of a hatch or small SUV)
* cute tail light design
* relatively good over bumps and stuff although could be smoother
* reliability!!!!!!

&#x200B;

Things I don't like:

* SOUND SYSTEM - it's so bad I'm considering having a friend who teaches auto mechanics having his class use it as a project to replace the speakers, add a sub, and sound deadening material throughout the car (which would actually be really nice regardless of speakers bc it is kinda loud....)
* sometime's it's kinda jerky?? it's not predictable and that drives me crazy. sometimes if I take my foot off the brake a little too fast the car kind of lurches instead of smoothly rolling forward. stuff like that.
* road noise and roughness on the road (I feel like I can really feel the texture of the road under me not necessarily being jostled around just what the surface texture is
* wish the steering was a bit sharper
* seats super uncomfortable. Ordered a lumbar support thingy gonna see how that works...
* Dash is ok looking and I like that it's simple but doesn't feel very luxe
* button for blind spot camera is on the end of the turn signal which is annoying

&#x200B;

Bottom line is every time I see a Mazda I am filled with regret. I definitely need to drive again to see if I am right.

I paid cash so I can sell it pretty much whenever and not take too much of a hit financially (would sell not trade). If I have the sound system upgraded including sound deadening (for around $1000 or less in parts) do you think it will do the trick? Or should I just get out now and get something that works for me without having to put in more $ to upgrade?

&#x200B;

Honda,Stream,"BlackBerry: A Legacy Stock That‚Äôs Going To Get Re-Rated And Run | BlackBerry is not a dead brand. It‚Äôs not a failed smartphone company. It‚Äôs not just another stock that spikes when retail traders pile in and then disappears.

It is a deeply entrenched, high-margin infrastructure software business that has gone completely unnoticed in the AI-driven rally. While every software stock remotely connected to AI, IoT, or automation trades at sky-high valuations, BlackBerry‚Äîwhich powers 255M+ vehicles and counting‚Äîstill trades like a company with no future.

The reality is different. BlackBerry dominates real-time, safety-critical automotive systems with its QNX operating system, and it‚Äôs now layering on a SaaS-like business with IVY, a cloud-based vehicle data platform co-developed with AWS.

IVY allows automakers to process, analyze, and monetize vehicle sensor data in real time. This is exactly the kind of AI-adjacent, cloud-powered software business that should be trading at 10x revenue, yet the market assigns it zero value.

That will not last much longer.

* QNX is embedded in 255M+ vehicles and continues to expand at 20M+ per year.
* IVY has secured early adopters, including Foxconn‚Äôs MIH EV platform, Dongfeng, and Mitsubishi Electric.
* The cybersecurity division, generating $350M‚Äì$365M annually, is now stabilized and profitable.

Every other infrastructure software business with this kind of positioning has already been re-rated higher‚Äîthis one just hasn‚Äôt caught up yet.

# The Trade: BlackBerry Gets Re-Rated in the Next 2‚Äì3 Quarters‚ÄîPossibly as Soon as Earnings April 2nd

QNX is growing, IVY is ramping up, and cybersecurity has stabilized, yet the stock price still reflects none of this.

* If BlackBerry provides strong IVY guidance next earnings, the re-rating could start immediately.
* Even without IVY, QNX‚Äôs backlog alone justifies a higher multiple.
* Cybersecurity, previously a drag on performance, is now quietly generating cash.

This setup provides a margin of safety with significant upside.

Even if IVY takes time to scale, QNX alone is worth more than what the market is assigning to BlackBerry today.

If the market re-rates BlackBerry as an infrastructure software business, it trades at $12‚Äì$18 in the next 2‚Äì3 quarters. That does not include IVY guidance or it's potential impact on price, which could drive the stock much higher.

# QNX: The Operating System Running Inside 255M+ Vehicles

QNX is not an infotainment OS‚Äîit‚Äôs the real-time, safety-critical software running inside automotive systems.

* Installed in 255M+ vehicles, growing by 20M+ per year
* $815M backlog (+27% YoY) ensures forward revenue visibility
* Trusted by nearly every major automaker, including BMW, Toyota, Ford, GM, Volkswagen, Honda, Stellantis, Bosch, Continental, Magna, and Denso

QNX is embedded in ADAS, digital instrument clusters, telematics, and secure gateways‚Äîsystems where failure is not an option. Automakers don‚Äôt replace this kind of software lightly, which is why QNX enjoys high retention and a long revenue tail.

As vehicles become more software-driven, QNX‚Äôs role is only growing.

* Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) require real-time OS solutions that QNX already dominates
* QNX Hypervisor enables multiple systems to run securely on a single chip, increasing its value per vehicle
* EVs and autonomous systems require low-latency, high-reliability computing‚Äîexactly what QNX provides

If QNX were valued like a strategic AI-driven infrastructure software provider, it would not be trading at 5x revenue.

A more appropriate 8‚Äì10x multiple puts QNX‚Äôs valuation at $2.5B‚Äì$3.5B alone.

Right now, the market is treating QNX like a legacy asset when it‚Äôs actually growing and gaining importance.

# IVY: The Unpriced SaaS Upside That Could Change the Entire Valuation

BlackBerry IVY is a co-developed vehicle data platform with AWS that allows automakers to process, analyze, and monetize in-car data.

* Foxconn‚Äôs MIH EV platform, Dongfeng Motors, and Mitsubishi Electric have already signed on
* IVY enables software-driven revenue streams for automakers (subscriptions, upgrades, real-time analytics)
* BlackBerry captures recurring revenue from these services

Right now, the market assigns IVY zero value because revenue has not yet scaled.

But automakers are moving toward Tesla-style in-car software features, usage-based pricing, and over-the-air upgrades.

If IVY becomes the data layer that enables this shift, BlackBerry‚Äôs valuation moves toward SaaS multiples instead of just embedded software.

And we will know a lot more by next earnings.

# Cybersecurity: No Longer a Drag, Now a Cash Generator

For years, BlackBerry‚Äôs cybersecurity business was bloated and uncompetitive.

* Then management sold off Cylance, cut unnecessary costs, and focused on high-trust, high-retention government and enterprise contracts.
* Cybersecurity now generates $350M‚Äì$365M annually with a $280M ARR & Margins have improved to 65%
* Trusted by NATO, Fortune 500s, and government agencies

This is not a high-growth business, but it is a stable, profitable enterprise software business that the market is ignoring.

Even at a conservative 2‚Äì4x revenue multiple, cybersecurity alone could be worth $700M‚Äì$1.2B.

Right now, the market is treating this business as worthless, which makes no sense.

# Market Mispricing: How Big Is the Upside?

BlackBerry is currently trading at \~5x sales, significantly below comparable infrastructure software businesses.

If the market re-rates BlackBerry as a legitimate infrastructure software provider, the stock is an easy double from here.

A reasonable valuation based on its components:

* QNX at 8‚Äì10x revenue ‚Üí $2.5B‚Äì$3.5B
* Cybersecurity at 2‚Äì4x revenue ‚Üí $700M‚Äì$1.2B
* IVY is completely unpriced‚Äîif it scales, it could be worth billions

**This pushes BlackBerry‚Äôs fair value toward $12‚Äì$18 in the next 2‚Äì3 quarters on the low end, $20+ on the high end if IVY scales.**

If IVY guidance is strong next earnings, that re-rating could start immediately.

# Final Thought: The Market Is About to Wake Up

This is not a meme stock revival.

It is an AI-adjacent, embedded infrastructure software business that has somehow escaped the AI stock rally.

That will not last much longer.

* QNX should not be trading like a no-growth legacy product
* IVY is being assigned zero value, despite real partnerships and revenue potential
* Cybersecurity is now a stable asset, not a liability

This stock is one strong IVY earnings guide away from a re-rating to juicy SAAS multiples. BlackBerry is almost certainly about to be priced like a great software company instead of a clown show. When that happens, it‚Äôs not trading anywhere near $5.69 anymore.

I‚Äôve put together the above analysis of BlackBerry. I work on these memos for my own personal investments and want to start sharing them. Thought you degens might like them.

I'm going to be posting diligence on reddit regularly, but only on r/wallstreetbets for positions in my personal book. Follow me on directly if you want to read more.

**TLDR:** My analysis indicates BlackBerry is a high-margin software business that the market doesn't believe could operate a coffee cart at an airport. Their IOT businesses includes the dominant OS for automotive software and an emerging SaaS platform co-developed with AWS both of which should command high multiples. The stock trades at a massive discount to comparable AI-adjacent infrastructure software businesses. In a base case, the stock should trade at $12‚Äì$18 in the next 2‚Äì3 quarters and if IOT guidance is strong next earnings it can pop to 20+. | # **TLDR**

---

**Ticker:** BB

**Direction:** Up

**Prognosis:** Buy (Author's personal investment)

**Price Target:** $12-18 (conservative), $20+ (bullish, dependent on IVY guidance)

**Reason:** BlackBerry's QNX (automotive OS) and IVY (SaaS platform) businesses are undervalued by the market, despite significant growth potential.  Their cybersecurity division is also profitable and stable.  The author believes a re-rating is imminent, particularly if IVY shows strong guidance in the next earnings report.

**Bonus:** Author thinks the market currently believes BlackBerry couldn't even run a coffee cart at the airport.",,,,,,,
Hyundai,Accent,"Hyundai Accent owners how is your experience in maintenance? | Sa mga Hyundai Accent owners po kumusta po ang maintenance ng sasakyan niyo. I'm planning to buy this car 2013 model. Gusto ko po sana malaman if madali makahanap ng parts nito if may mga need napalitan since 2nd po ang balak ko bilihin. | 2020 HAC owner.

Mas maraming parts available for older HAC.

Kappa Engine MPI - madali maintain. DIY. 
I change CVT fluid every year. 

I change Engine oil every 1K km or less dahil lang ongoing ang slow motion tuning nya with Liqui Moly products. 3rd engine oil flush na next week. 

Yung coolant napalitan ko na rin. Pero since older yan, check for rust. Usually dyan mo makita kung kamote ang owner. Kung makalawang, wag mo na bilhin. Lumipat na sa ibang parts ng cooling system and heater core. Wag kang bumili ng mahilig sa tubig tubig lang. Kamote tlaga. Mahal ayusin ang engine issue FYI. 

For my car, tahimik sya parang EV. This is a disadvantage din for people around you. 

The brake system of my car is very different from older models. Ang gamit sa old models is disc brake for the rear. It should be easy to change pero mas di nagtatagal. 

The HACs have parts kasi may models made in the Philippines, not China. Assembled in the Philippines din at least yung 2020 HAC.",,,,,,,

Hyundai,I130,"Breaking Down Bates | 1. The Stew Crew quietly totaled their super expensive Tesla and thought about keeping it a secret, but of course they didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶& instead turned it into a Clickbait title for their vlog complete with their kids posing and pretending to be horrified. They probably won‚Äôt replace it bc they have 2 other vehicles and will wait for a Hyundai sponsorship like the Clarks received. Besides this, we learn that Zade will finally see a speech therapist, their influencer friends are coming for the week and they plan to go on vacation with Evan‚Äôs family. I guess his parents have decided to accept the exploitation so things are back to normal. Hope NiNi remembers to lock the bathroom door! Layla went to ballet class and Carlin filmed her hamming it up for the camera. They get their nails done, cut off almost all of Zade‚Äôs hair and Carlin takes pictures of herself doodling in church. What are we to make of the curly q‚Äôs and flowers around Pastor Justin‚Äôs name?? Layla now exclusively wears a tutu or a princess gown. Carlin sells: a $130 workout outfit, colostrum, pajamas,  skin repair spray, jewelry, some chicken poop colored hydro jugs, saie beauty, dibs makeup and finally, BSB. Katie and Travis spend the week hanging out and making content, including spinning their daughters upside down. Carlin has to have Evan spin her upside down also bc we all know Layla is her direct competition. They are all totally and completely shocked when they lose power bc according to Carlin, that should not happen bc they live in a city‚Ä¶Carlin posts a picture of Layla with Josie‚Äôs girls and Willow is twice the size of Layla. We see Layla at Target begging for everything she sees and also at the mall with Khloe. Khloe is able to pick Layla up. Carlin posts a picture of herself with Josie and Katie and labels it ‚Äúsisters‚Äù. Somewhere, Whitney screams.

2. Welp, the messiah of the Clark Family has still not arrived forcing the Clark‚Äôs to film yet another final update before the baby‚Äôs arrival. This time they mean it. Katie has a checkup and Travis forces her to post her cervix‚Äôs business for all the world to know. Influencers don‚Äôt have maternity leave so Katie had to work over time this week selling and exploiting. She films her daughter in the tub in order to sell a hair mask and says people wanted the details of her ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù‚Ä¶a sweatshirt and shorts. She and Travis try to make us believe their microwave meals are yummy but they can‚Äôt even show Travis‚Äôs meat and he breaks a sweat trying to cut his steak off camera. Katie says her‚Äôs is delicious as she shoves it around the box even though it looks like wet trash. Travis runs off camera and appears to spit his in the trash. She then turns into a veritable auctioneer as she slings links for: Tula, kitsch , target, flipflops and SEVEN links for her hospital bag plus 14 links for her baby caddie. She is selling a home cleaning service and promotes the boutique by strolling through the shop pulling out piles of clothes that she takes for free. Hailey has to clock in and make a reel with her dad choosing story books to read and pretending to sleep next to him. She also swims at the Stew Crew pool so they can film her in a bathing suit and Travis can be on camera shirtless. They promise to exploit baby Harvey the second he arrives‚Ä¶ which should be soon they hope. 

3. Josie really wants to be a TikTok girlie and recaps her weekend using the popular ‚Äúa day in the life‚Äù style. Kelton was cheffing it up grilling steaks for a friends dinner and obviously they heard us cracking on their sides bc he has asparagus and Mexican street corn. We see Willow completing a workbook page and she moves the camera 25 times to get the best booty shots while she works out at the gym. As her quest to be the Fundie Thot Queen continues her leggings get tighter and we see her choose a bra. she is shilling AG1 again and actually takes a few swallows on camera. We go to gymnastics class with the girls and they seem to be alone in the gym but at least she is only exploiting her own kids and not other people‚Äôs like Carlin. Baby Miles is now old enough to eat so there is now a third kid officially on Josie‚Äôs payroll. Time for him to start pulling his weight. Josie hosts a baby shower for the fundie barber‚Äôs wife in an echoing room that is so white it must be an insane asylum. Lydia is there but none of the other sisters appear to be. After a full day of filming herself it‚Äôs time for her to lock herself in the bathroom and‚Ä¶ film herself so you can shop her links for teeth strips, body oil and self tanner. After a long day at the coffee shop and the gym‚Ä¶Josie once again tells us that she is going to undergo a dramatic, unbelievable hair makeover‚Ä¶ she films as the hairdresser trims her super fried and frizzled split ends, applies the hair color and she emerges‚Ä¶ looking exactly the same as always. Long. Blonde. The end. 

4. Alyssa Webster took a much needed social media break this week. I guess the hats are officially dead. Sure hope the girls get their toy cabinet back! She did post for Daughter‚Äôs Day and per usual, featured a story that cut Allie out. She just refuses to give up that YouTube vlog no matter how painful it is and this week we got 9 minutes of the girls wearing oversized karate uniforms while they awkwardly kick and slap at each other and Alyssa hollers in the background encouraging them to KICK, HIT, GET HER, GET HER, SHE‚ÄôS OPEN. Like, what the hell am I watching?? Of course she never cheers for Allie and it really feels like she wants one of them to clean her clock. Highly disturbing and the commenters let her know. These girls want to be princess mermaid fairies and dance the nutcracker or tumble and twirl and walk the balance beam. Instead they are in some weird dudes basement pretending to take karate. The Websters are weirdos and something just seems OFF. Alyssa made her comeback to IG with another unboxing video that was just like the last 50. There she is all dolled up, alone, frenetically ripping open boxes to reveal some handmaid‚Äôs tale dresses for her and the girls. The little girl dress looks exactly like the grown woman dress and Alyssa is giddy and plans a photo shoot. Perhaps the girls can slap and kick each other while IN these prairie Dawn gunny sacks.

5.  Whitney Bates‚Äô entire house is full of magnetic picture frames. It must look like the front of a Frigidaire in her living room bc that woman is forever promoting Mix Tiles. And skin repair. And teeth whitening strips. And this week‚Ä¶ a money saving app. Can you believe that the exact same things that Travis and Katie found with this app, Whitney found too?? What a coincidence‚Ä¶ Zach can say he‚Äôs a real estate agent all he wants but there he is on the BSB page, packaging orders on a Tuesday afternoon. The Bates Kitchen was back in business this week ‚Äúbulling‚Äù water and ‚Äúpilling‚Äù potatoes. Zach rolled out 2 videos this week and has really stepped up his game. No more McCormick‚Äôs seasoning bottles and great value cartons of milk and cheese on camera. He also learned how to shoot a close up. First up is a seafood pasta using some huge steaming contraption he wants you to buy. He calls the pasta noodles, doesn‚Äôt wash his hands after ripping into raw lobster and slurps over the pan while slinging cheese everywhere. He says it tastes ‚Äúseafoody‚Äù‚Ä¶ ya think?? Next up is potato soup and this is sponsored by those same gross microwave meals the Clark‚Äôs have. Why would a cooking show be sponsored by a microwave meal‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt. Anyway, he adds 17 cups of cheese and 2 pints of sour cream to 4 potatoes and then leaves us with a melted cheese covered smile. We have come so far, and yet there is still so far to go.

6. Do not tell your secrets to Trace Bates. He leaks like a sieve. In this weeks Q and A he tells us that Chad and Erin are moving back to Tennessee at the end of the year and he plans to go back to working with Chad‚Ä¶ then Lydia pinches him and he tries to cover by saying ‚ÄúIF they come back‚Äù‚Ä¶.too late Trace! He also tells us that his job is now social media and by the way, would you like to buy a couch? Lydia lies and says they are 50/50 on childcare and then Trace lies and says he doesn‚Äôt care that Lydia is taller than him. Those stiletto boots say otherwise, bubba. They tell us that Lydia was approved for her I130 and we know from 90 day fianc√© that this is the first step towards a green card. It took 15 months to receive it. Of course they want more children and they will stack them up in the 650 square foot apartment bc according to Trace, interest rates are high. In her ongoing effort to make her one year old seven, Lydia gave Ryker light up rain boots. They also have 2 new electric bikes and a Tesla was parked in their yard. Trace says he only likes helping his dad in the tree business if it‚Äôs an easy tree that he can cut and leave. He should cut and leave these vlogs.

7. Michael has a huge fall sale on her baby blankets and hats. This week she borrows Kade and Kolter from Tori and they hot glue dried beans and rice on a piece of paper. You can hear the other Smith kids in the background. Michael should get a pot and cook those crafting items and give this weird form of exploitation a rest already. 

8.  Tiffy Bates is trying to get in the influencer game and is selling a baby monitor. She says baby Will is getting so longand shares more pictures from the car museum. We see her put their huge camera with boom mic approximately 2 centimeters from the baby‚Äôs face and snap away. Lawson continues to rage bait his followers by feeding the baby held out in front of him and folded in half. He tells us they took Will to see some boring old house. Lawson is the only one we ever see holding or feeding the baby. Who wants to bet things are very different when a camera isn‚Äôt on?

9.  Erin checks in after the hurricane and shows her kids on a walk and being allowed to eat fruit. She has a reel of them riding bikes through mud puddles. Carson‚Äôs bike is equipped with a baby carriage and the 2 littles are in it as he flies through the mud and they hold on for dear life. We see HollyDolly covered in Florida swamp mud and this whole thing just reeks of water born bacteria and‚Ä¶ leeches. Speaking of leeches‚Ä¶ Chad and Erin sit down with some evangelist that taught at Clown College and now is grifting his way through American churches. They ask him questions but I refused to listen to any of it. Their brainwashing seems complete. They forgot to ask him the most important question of all, which is‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúCan we stay at your house for a while??‚Äù

10. Bits and Bytes‚Ä¶ Kelly Jo reported that Poppa Bill and JaneJane lost some trees, a cow and power during the storm‚Ä¶ Josie says her hair and skin tone are monochromatic. Her entire LIFE is monochromatic‚Ä¶ Katie is selling a hair mask and has a head full of extensions‚Ä¶

Hyundai,I800,"Hyundai i800 sell ? | My disabled mum has a Hyundai i800 2012 , 142000 miles that had breaks done 2 months ago but recently the coolant started leaking and now has a suspected head gasket gone. Quoted at least  ¬£3000 to repair by 2 garages for replacement coolant pipes and head gasket repair.

She can afford (just about) to fix it ( with partial 0% repair loan ) but would it be better just to sell it and get something else ? 

On autotrader at that mileage as a runner they can fetch nearly ¬£8000. So not worth scrapping but I don‚Äôt want to spend ¬£3000 if that would be better spent on just getting another preowned automatic 7 seater ( if so ,what car ?). A car on finance is not an option.

One of the garages advised me just to plead ignorance and sell it to we buy any car. But don‚Äôt want to risk any thing coming back on my mum with us now taking it to 2 garages and being told about suspected head gasket failure.

Hyundai,Montana,"Bye America: A practical guide for patriotic Canadians | Hello r/canada

Long-time reader, first-time poster.

With Trump arbitrarily imposing tariffs on Canadian products and services, apparently as a starting point of a bigger economic war and possible annexation of Canada, now is the time for Canadians to stand together against his aggression. This post is meant to be practical, actionable ideas for all Canadians to resist Trump‚Äôs tariffs. Let's send the message to Trump: if you don't want to do business with Canada, you have no business here at all.

This is also a starting point. It‚Äôs unlikely that anyone will be able to do all of these things, all of the time, but the more people who do them, and the more of them we do, the bigger the impact will be. Many of the suggested Canadian alternatives are not present in every province. Please add your feedback and other ideas in the comments, and I will try to update the post.

Update: Thanks for all the comments! Have modified the list to correct and update it. A couple of useful websites flagged by other users.

# Don‚Äôt shop at American-owned stores.

Not all of the alternatives are Canadian-owned; they are simply not American. You can also just shop local, as many Canadians own non-chain businesses providing these goods and services

**Retail and consumer goods**

* Amazon ‚Üí depends what you‚Äôre buying, but there are always alternatives
* Walmart ‚Üí Loblaws, Metro, Canadian Tire, Co-op (in the west)

* Home Depot -> Home Hardware, Rona
* Nike ‚Üí Lululemon, Roots, Nobis, Canada Goose, Aritzia
* Levi‚Äôs ‚Üí Naked & Famous

**Food and beverage**

* McDonald‚Äôs, Wendy‚Äôs, KFC, Five Guys ‚Üí Harvey's, A&W Canada, Burger‚Äôs Priest, Hero Certified Burgers, Mary Brown's (chicken)

# Don‚Äôt buy American goods.

This will be difficult, because so many of our day-to-day consumer products are owned by American companies. That said, the big Canadian grocery and drug store chains have their own-brand ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù versions of most of these American products, which are probably cheaper than the brand-name versions. When in doubt, check the label.

* Procter & Gamble (Tide, Gillette, Pampers, etc.) ‚Üí Attitude, Green Beaver
* Johnson & Johnson (Tylenol, Band-Aid, Aveeno, etc.) ‚Üí Life Brand (Shoppers Drug Mart), Jamieson Vitamins, Rexall
* Colgate-Palmolive (Colgate toothpaste, Irish Spring, Softsoap, etc.) ‚Üí Green Beaver
* Unilever (Dove, Hellmann‚Äôs, etc.) ‚Üí Canadian soap makers, President‚Äôs Choice Mayo
* Coca-Cola (includes Dasani, Powerade, etc.) ‚Üí PC Cola, Clearly Canadian

* Campbell‚Äôs Soup ‚Üí Habitant (by Loblaws), Baxters
* Hershey‚Äôs (Reese‚Äôs, Twizzlers, etc.) ‚Üí Nestl√© (Switzerland), Canadian chocolate makers (Purdy‚Äôs, Laura Secord)
* Mars (M&M‚Äôs, Snickers, etc.) ‚Üí Cadbury, Canadian brands like Ganong
* Mondelez (Oreo, Ritz, Triscuit, etc.) ‚Üí Dare, local bakeries
* General Mills (Cheerios, Nature Valley, etc.) ‚Üí Nature‚Äôs Path (Canadian), Love Grown

Worth noting (thanks commenter!) that [Well.ca](http://Well.ca) allows you filter for Canadian products

# Use Canadian transportation

* **Gas:** Esso, Chevron, and Shell ‚Üí  Petro-Canada, Husky, Irving
* **Rides:**  Uber and Lyft ‚Üí Use local taxi services (e.g., Beck Taxi, TappCar) or transit

# Don‚Äôt buy American services.

Hard to avoid some of these, but not impossible.

* Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Paramount+ ‚Üí Crave, CBC Gem, CBC Kids, BritBox, Mubi
* Hollywood (Warner Bros, Universal, etc.) ‚Üí try some Canadian cinema like TIFF films or the Banff Mountain Films
* Google Drive, Dropbox ‚Üí [Sync.com](http://Sync.com), Proton Drive (Swiss)
* Twitter/X (stay away, since it‚Äôs owned by Elon Musk) ‚Üí Bluesky, Mastodon
* Electronic Arts (video games) ‚Üí Ubisoft Montreal

# Don‚Äôt buy American cars, or at least buy a car made in Canada.

It‚Äôs obviously impossible to buy a car without any American parts. But, if you‚Äôre buying new, at least support Canadian auto workers.

Non-American cars made in Canada:

* Honda CR-V
* Toyota RAV4
* Lexus RX

Foreign car companies to consider ‚Äî but check if their cars are assembled in the US:

* Honda & Toyota ‚Äì Strong presence in Canada (CR-V, RAV4, and Lexus RX are built in Ontario).
* Mazda, Subaru, Nissan (includes Infiniti), Hyundai (includes Genesis), Kia ‚Äì Mostly Japanese or Korean, no American ownership.
* Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo ‚Äì European and not American-owned.

American cars assembled in Canada:

* Chrysler 300
* Dodge Charger, Dodge Challenger
* Ford Edge, Lincoln Nautilus
* Ram 1500
* Ford Superduty
* Chevrolet Silverado
* GMC Sierra

American car brands to avoid (no manufacturing presence in Canada), other than the models assembled in Canada that are listed above:

* Tesla - Obviously stay away from these, given Elon Musk‚Äôs role enabling Trump. Consider Polestar, Hyundai, Nissan, Volkswagen or Kia instead if looking to go electric
* Ford
* Chevrolet
* GMC
* Buick
* Cadillac
* Dodge
* Jeep
* Ram

# Don‚Äôt go to America, but be friendly and welcoming to Americans

* **Cancel any vacations in the United States.** There are plenty of things to see and do in Canada. Honestly, our dollar is likely to tank anyway, so American vacations are going to become more expensive

# What else? | Hi everyone - we took a while to reflect on this one, and decided it was so well done and with a positive, active intent that it was worthwhile posting here.¬†

We remain committed to our sub's rules - please no full hatred and avoid generalizations. Ultimately we do need to come out the other side of this able to work with our neighbours, friends, and loved ones from the south, although there's no clarity on how long this will go on.

But Canadians have a strong history of kindness and togetherness, until someone takes advantage of that kindness. Then we plan, and act smartly and conclusively. This is that.

Edit: also a reminder that these are the products that Canada is creating tariffs for (the prior topic from r/canada)

Hyundai,Veloster,"2 Year Review of my Hyundai Veloster N | Pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/02NSuRP](https://imgur.com/a/02NSuRP)

I recently crossed two years and 30k miles with my Hyundai Veloster N. I ordered the car slightly used off carvana (yes, I was very desperate to find one). The car is a 2020 Performance Blue car with the Performance package. Performance Package was a $2000 option, later standard on 2021+ Veloster Ns, that gave extra power, 19 in rims, better brakes, limited slip differential, and a valved exhaust. The bucket seats were not available and neither was the DCT on the 2020. Which is fine with me, I still prefer the bolstered cloth seats and the 6 speed manual. Car is still bone stock except for swapping out the Hyundai specfic Pirelli's for Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires.

After two years of ownership I still really enjoy this car. I've formed an attachment to it that I never expected. I'm still so impressed with how this car drives and I've got to drive a lot of truly amazing cars since purchasing my VN. GT350 (again), Camaro SS 1LE, two R35 GT-Rs (one I bought), and a 991.2 GT3 to name a few. They are all obviously on a completely different level of performance than the VN but, I can still return to the VN and have a great time behind the wheel. The VN hasn't been made irrelevant because I've driven better cars, if anything the opposite has happened. I've come to appreciate more so just how good the balance between the chassis, the steering, and the power is. The turn into corners is so responsive, you can feel the front end loading up through the steering, and you can get on the power early and feel the front e-diff working to put the power down as you rocket out of corners. In long sweeping corners you get enough feedback that you can approach your limits and hang on as you carry high speeds. It makes you confident as a driver and all together it just feels fantastic to drive quickly.

For me, there's only a few negatives worth mentioning. Your use case could be very different than mine so you may have more negatives. My biggest issues are with the transmission, engine, and the fuel economy. The manual transmission has moments of greatness where I really am surprised how great a shift felt. Other times, like the 1-2 gear shift, feel very clunky and like it refuses to go into gear. The engine is kind of boring. It makes good power all the way to its redline and feels like it could be revving much higher but, there's not much drama and if I'm parked, without the exhaust open, I occasionally wonder if the car is still running. The exhaust has all the character. Fuel economy isn't great in the city. Off boost in 5th/6th gear it's good 28-33 mpg but, on boost it's real bad and unfortunately from a stop it needs boost to get moving. You could argue some of this is on my driving style but, most of the time I'm not driving aggressive and I still see under 20mpg in the city and with a 12 gallon fuel tank it can go pretty quickly.

Maintenance for the car has been pretty routine. I get it serviced every 3-5k miles. All service done through my local Hyundai service center. Service breaks down as follows:

&#x200B;

|Cost|Mileage|Maintenance|
|:-|:-|:-|
|$94.36|9k|Oil, Oil Filer, Tire rotation|
|$96.25|12k|Alignment|
|$63.81|13k|Oil, Oil Filter|
|$267.31|17k|Oil, (Oil, Cabin, Engine) Filter, Tire rotation, Throttle Body|
|$97.81|21k|Oil, Oil Filter, Tire rotation|
|$76.46|25k|Oil, Oil Filter|
|$621.88|29k|Oil, (Oil, Cabin, Engine) Filter, Tire rotation, Throttle Body, A/C Refresh, Brake Fluid, Fuel Injector|
|$1,232.60 + $115.56|29k|Four tires, Tire installation|
|Total: $2,666.04|||

Many owners report the fuel pump going out on these cars after 20k miles or so. I have not had that issue. The car hasn't really given me any issues. Only warranty repairs stuff is the clear coat on the rims was peeling and some heat shielding came loose and was vibrating against the exhaust. The interior has held up surprisingly well for being made out of plastic. There have been some interior rattles but, nothing too obnoxious or that I haven't been able to remedy.

Hyundai dealership experience is... okay. It definitely was a point of frustration in the beginning but, has since gotten better. I still think it has a ways to go but, after a few MYs of the VN, the Elantra N, and the Kona N it appears as though they've gotten more familiar with these cars. For example, they finally have the correct oil in stock for these cars.

Overall, I couldn't be more happy with my purchase and I know a lot of owner's that took a chance on this car feel the same way. If you really enjoy driving, the positives of this car far exceed the negatives. I usually have a plan for what car is next but, it has been such a treat to drive everyday that it is not going to be easy to replace. There's more options for ""hot hatches"" than in 2020 when I started looking but, I think at this point I'd have to go up market to find something more enjoyable. | You may want to change your transmission fluid.

 | i20 Asta IVT (prefacelift 2021) owner here

1) Great fit-and-finish, interiors feel a segment above. Everyone who gets in the car praises how smart the interior is.

2) Cheap to own, maintenance cost is very reasonable.

3) Had a few crashes and bumps in the city (Mumbai), service centre guys were very prompt and professional, repair work exceeded expectations.

4) Infotainment and technology is a class apart, everything works as expected, no issues faced in the last 3 years.

5) Highway manners are good, car feels stable. Although engine lacks the oomph for quick overtakes.

6) City comfort and refinement are segment best, easily. Driveability is also good.

7) Never left me stranded, reliable for sure.

8) IVT mileage is not good, averages 7-8kmpl in Mumbai in heavy traffic. Highway runs yield upto 15kmpl. Mixed usage returns 10-12kmpl.

Would recommend to anyone who:-

1) Needs a car for primarily city runs.

2) Does short highway trips.

3) Needs a premium, feature loaded, comfort oriented family car.

4) Needs a secondary car.

5) Drives infrequently (less than 300km running per month).

Would NOT recommend to anyone who:-

1) Does a lot of highway miles (consider NLine).

2) Needs lots of fuel efficiency.

3) Does over 500km per month (fuel economy will be poor).

4) Does a lot of spirited driving and hard acceleration (consider NLine).",,,,,,,

Hyundai,i40,"Hyundai i40 known issues | Hi All,

I'm considering buying a 2013 i40 sedan for USD11,000 so I'm doing some research on things to look out for. Details about it:

77,000 kms
2.0 Petrol
Automatic Transmission
Panoramic sunroof
Leather seats
AFLS red warning on the dash (should this be a deal breaker?)

After doing some research, I found some issues both on the diesel and petrol engines. The petrol engines issues seems to be realted to the GDI engine itself, right? Do all 2.0 petrol engines have the same issue? Apparently (according to Wikipedia) there are two variants of the 2.0 engine:

2.0 L¬†Nu¬†I4¬†164hp/150hp
2.0 L¬†Nu¬†GDI¬†I4¬†176hp/162hp

According to the place selling the car, it's got 160hp so none of these matches that. Most likely a mistake on their side not to specify the right hp numbers, however, I'd like to know if both of these have the same issues. I currently have a 2016 SantaFe with the 2.4 engine but it's (as far as I know) not the GDI version (because of the region) so I haven't had any issues so far with it with almost 70,000 kms nor I have heard of anyone in the area having the issues usually associated with the GDI version so I'm curious about this being a similar scenario, in which the engine is still a 2.0 but it's not a GDI so the same issues shouldn't apply(?).

Still, I'd like to know a bit more about things to look for in the car, I'm probably going for a test drive next weekend and I'm between that or a 2012 Honda Accord V6.

Any comments, feedback or details will be appreciated! | Hey, how did it go, did you get the i40? Are you satisfied?",,,,,,,

Hyundai,ix35,"Thoughts on a 2013 Hyundai ix35 (Europe) | I just moved to SE Europe-- and usually I'm the guy who people ask when they're shopping for a car in the US, but I'm out of my element here.

I've always driven Honda, Audi, Mazda, Subaru and Acuras and, although I try not to be a brand snob, I've never had Hyundai on my radar.

However, my girlfriend's parents are getting ready to trade in their 2013 Hyundai ix35 (diesel, 6 speed manual) this fall and offered us a pretty great deal on it. About 11k euros paid over 4 years-- and similar ix35s seem to be around $13-15k. The car is in good shape, no accidents and only has around 56kms on it. Overall quality isn't mind blowing and it's not the most dynamic vehicle to drive, but it's certainly a decent little SUV and it suits our needs really well.

In the US I'd normally pick up a $6-8k car and call it a day. But in this country, there's an issue with wrecked foreign cars being refurbed and sold; a friend and car guy went as far as importing a VW from Germany to make sure he didn't have one with issues. The other issue is that car prices are strangely high; a 2009 Golf, for example, with 175000 kms still goes for 10-12k euros. Anything in a price range where I could pay cash is... sketchy. I really, really, really don't want to buy new unless I absolutely have to.

I want to make a good choice and buy a safe, reliable car for my girlfriend and I to drive (until I can add a fun car to the garage, too!). Is this a good idea, or should I be looking elsewhere? | The ix35 is a perfectly good motor. If you know it's history and it's been maintained well then it is a much better bet than taking a chance with something unknown.

Technically it does have a FSH according to manufacturer guidance, but the guidance is every 21k miles or 2 years, which worries me. 

It has passed all of its MOTs without advisories though, so that gives confidence it has been taken care of.

Jaguar,I-Pace,"Considering buying a 2019 Jaguar I-Pace, talk me out of it | I was looking at Polestar 2 and Kia Niro and stumbled upon the I-pace. Normally I wouldn't consider a Jaguar but I know electric cars to generally have a more reliable drivetrain. I like the idea of the luxury and they're in the same price bracket albeit a few years older. 

  
I currently own a Tesla M3 SRP and have been very disappointed in the claimed range AND the charging times. The fastest charge I've ever acheived, even at the 250kw chargers, is in the 140s and only for a few minutes where it quickly drops down to 60s-70s. I don't really need the range as I don't do long road trips so if the Jaguar gets closer to it's stated range then I should be in the same ballpark as the M3

Any of you with the I-pace have major problems out of warranty?  | First, as others have mentioned, JLR is recalling all 2019 I Paces due to an LG Chem manufacturing defect in the battery modules. It‚Äôs the same defect that caused the Chevy Bolt recall. They are buying back all of the cars, so if you buy one, you‚Äôll be lucky to get your money back unless you get an unbelievable deal. You can input the VIN on JLR‚Äôs website to see the open recall(s).

Beyond that, charging speed with the I Pace is slow compared to newer EV‚Äôs (~90 kW), but you are right about one thing - its luxury can‚Äôt be topped for under $90k new. Range is largely based on driving style, terrain, and ambient temperature, so YMMV.

My point is, your analysis is completely flawed. The German luxury cars of similar years have not held residuals any better, after 7 to 10 years from being brand new. The notion that Jaguars somehow depreciate more than the BMWs and the Mercedes are completely incorrect. They're only somewhat true for the first three to five years from being brand new. 

After that, I would argue that BMW 8-cylinder cars with four doors fall off the chart faster in residual depreciation for similar mileage and condition, than the Jaguar V8s. There is a reason for that. 

Talk to real people who owned 8 cylinder BMWs ""used"" after the first 5 years of being brand new, and they are full of disastrous oil leaks, rubber seal failures, and almost no exceptions to that fate. Believe it or not, the Jaguar 8 cylinder engines are much more robust than typical German V8 engines. Other than coolant plastic pipe issues in the earlier variations, the Jags' engine block itself is rock solid.

HS automotive instructor, class project funded by me. I was going to do this by myself but students begged me to help.

86 Jaguar XJ6 w/ 74k.

2003 Express 3500 donor vehicle with 200k. Quick hone, rings and bearings. Decided after the fact to put a cam in it so we used the wood dowel trick so I didn't have to pull the heads(works!) 

Used an Amazon sheet metal intake to clear the hood but ended up with an LS1 intake once I could find one priced appropriately.

Students broke the bell housing two times and we tigged it back together, has been holding fine. 2400 stall converter.

2.5"" dual exhaust with J-pipes to eliminate drone. Very effective. Using two right side LS3 manifolds to clear the steering shaft.

Once it was drivable it was 'pretty quick' but I was annoyed with peg-leg burnouts so we put a 1994 XJ12 LSD in the back with 3.54 gears, from the factory 2.73. What a difference! Will burn the tires all the way through second from a stop if you punch it. The rear end was probably the worst part of the swap - what a pain. Did calipers/pads/rotors while I was in there - 10 hour job - with HS students, this took a couple weeks.

Corvette alternator with PWM controller, Taurus cooling fan with a high amp relay. Factory fuel pump but corvette filter/regulator. Stock injectors (for now). 

Used parts from Jaguar Specialties in CA for motor mounts and bushings, power steering lines, and wiring harness so the Jag instrument cluster works with the LS.

  
We will be taking it to the drag strip over April break. Hoping for something in the 13's after our second and final tune. It might be there.

Jaguar,XK 8,"√úberlege mir ein Jaguar XK 5.0L sp√§ter dieses Jahr zu kaufen | Hi liebe Autoliebhaber


Ich √ºberlege mir einen Jaguar XK, Baujahr 2010 oder neuer mit dem 385 PS 5.0L V8, zu kaufen, entweder zu Ende des Jahres oder Anfang n√§chsten Jahres. Ich wollte mich √ºber gew√∂hnliche Probleme und Reparaturen informieren, bevor ich eine betr√§chtliche Summe f√ºr ein Auto ausgebe was dann entweder mein n√§chstes Daily oder mein Zweitwagen f√ºr Wochenenden und andere Trips werden soll. Zurzeit fahre ich einen BMW E46 330i Touring mit 5-Gang-Schaltgetriebe, was auch mein Daily ist.

Bei meinen Recherche bin ich auf zwei Probleme gesto√üen, die bei den 5L-Motoren, insbesondere bei vorfacelift Modellen, einen finanziellen Totalschaden herrichten w√ºrden. Die Wasserpumpe kann kaputt gehen und den Motor stark besch√§digen bzw. √ºberhitzen lassen; oder die Steuerkette f√§llt aus oder verursacht andere Probleme im Motor. Was das Fahrwerk angeht, habe ich bisher nur gesehen, dass die D√§mpfer oder die Buchsen evtl. schlecht sein k√∂nnten, mehr Details habe ich aber nicht. Kennt jemand andere m√∂gliche Probleme, die mir zukommen k√∂nnten?

Ich bin auch auf ein besonders g√ºnstiges Exemplar gesto√üen (20500‚Ç¨), das bis vor kurzem √ºberhaupt keine Probleme hatte. Letzte Woche wurde der Preis jedoch von 24000‚Ç¨ auf aktuell 20500‚Ç¨ gesenkt. Der Grund daf√ºr ist, dass der Zylinder 8 eine niedrige Kompression von 7,5 bar hat. Das ist offenbar passiert, nachdem der H√§ndler das Auto leergefahren hat. Das allein deutet f√ºr mich nicht darauf hin, dass etwas mit dem Motorblock nicht stimmt oder der Kolben kaputt ist; Saugmotoren verlieren nicht einfach ohne Grund die Kompression. K√∂nnte es ein einfacher Fall von defekten Einspritzd√ºsen sein (wodurch das √ñl an den Zylinderw√§nden weggesp√ºlt wird) oder einfach nur Kraftstoffmangel? K√∂nnte es sogar eine schlechte Kopfdichtung/Ventildeckeldichtung sein? Zumindest der E46 ist daf√ºr bekannt, dass sie dadurch niedrige Kompression bekommen (unter anderem). Was sind die typischen Zylinderkompressionswerte f√ºr einen Jag XK? Bisher ich habe nur gelesen, dass der niedrigste Wert innerhalb von 10% des h√∂chsten Wertes/Durchschnitts der anderen Zylinder liegen muss, oder so √§hnlich.

I just got my P plate, and am looking for a hatch.

Everything seems quite overpriced, so I am currently looking at a new-ish car.

A lot of people recommend me to go with a Corolla or a Mazda 3, and ideally I would like to buy a Mazda 3, but even 2015-2016 models are close to 20K. I found a 2015 Mazda 3 for 14K from a private seller, and it turned out it was a written off. 

I just found a Kia Cerato Sport 2022 driven like 30,000kms, and the drive away cost is 23K. It has got some safety features included since it's Sport model, so I feel ok about the car. 
I think the price is not bad for a 2 year old car, but I am not so sure if it would be a good idea for me to get it. Apparently, Cerato will be discontinued after this year. 


Any advice would be really appreciated.

Lexus,GS 300H,"Trade in a lightly used ES 300h for a GS 350? | Hey all, 

I've had my 2022 ES 300h Ultra Luxury for just over 7 months now, and I just don't love it. There's a lot to like, but I never truly loved it for several reasons. 

When I was shopping for a car, I knew I wanted a hybrid or EV, so I used the MSRPs of Tesla Model 3, Toyota Camry, and Honda Accord to set my budget. I didn't like any of these, so started looking for used Lexus ES 300H in the same price range. I put a $35k CAD down payment on a $58k CAD car (that includes all taxes and fees), thinking I'd pay off the rest in about a year. I felt sick to my stomach after splashing such a big amount of money on a car, and the guilt has been eating me up ever since. My monthly payment is $552, which is not great, though not the worst either. But, I just can't fathom doing this for 3.5 more years, let alone make a $20k lump sum to pay off the loan. 

I test drove a 2017 GS 350 on two different occasions and enjoyed the smooth V6 and higher build quality. It's like they cheaped out a lot with the ES interior. I saw one today with the Executive package for $28k with 110k kms and test drove it. It comes with winter tires and a second set of wheels. Not a bad price, but the dealer lowballed me with a trade-in value of a whopping $38k, when I know for a fact that the value ranges from $38k-$49k for the model year and trim, and I showed the manager that this value came straight from AutoTrader, yet they acted dumb and ""oh this looks way different than our valuation, what could the reason be?"" I know the deal with wholesale values and all, but considering the fact that I have brand new winter tires, extended warranty, and 23k kms on the odometer, I think that figure is unfair and expected at least $45k from a Lexus dealer. They'll have no problem selling it for the same price they sold it to me or more and still make a profit. 

They seemed like they were willing to work on their valuation, but I wasn't prepared to fold and commit to a purchase on the spot. 

Tl;dr, am I stupid to trade in a perfectly good, economical car for one that will essentially be paid off, even though it is obviously more dated, driven way more, and is a gas guzzler? Moral of the story is that I realized that I would much rather pay cash for a car than have the burden of a monthly payment on my shoulders. | **Thank you for posting to r/Lexus.

I am confused between the IS and ES (250 or 350). I know ES is better for the comfort and IS is more of a sports version. Could you guys recommend me a good year and a car that would be still awesome to ride and use for a couple of years? | You understand the major difference between these two cars. The IS isn't uncomfortable, but its BMW-like design allows for sharp handling at speed. The ES is built more like a Camry than a BMW, so it's just good at being comfortable, space-efficient and cheap. 

The other big difference between these two is back seat space. The IS' back seat is tiny; the ES' is huge. If you want something with a bigger back seat, and the sporting capability of the IS, you should look at the GS. 

All of these cars are going to be reliable for a couple of years, so that's a non-issue. 

I would recommend the ES to most people as a daily driver, but that's just because there's a hybrid model (ES300h) that gets much better fuel economy. The V6 is relatively expensive to fuel, though the IS350 and ES350 are basically the same in that respect.",,,,,,,

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/SUO3oCKv95)  **Feb 9, 2018**

So this is coming to a head because at the moment we are on a ski vacation with my family. For the most part we are having a great time and have my parents, brother and kids and my aunt and cousins and their respective kids. It's a great time. 

My husband lives for this stuff but while we are being more social, he's in the lift line at 9 and he comes off the mountain at 4:30 like clockwork. He doesn't take hot chocolate breaks with us and he doesn't eat lunch with us. He will eat at the family dinner but instead of staying up telling stories and drinking wine, he goes to bead and listens to music until he falls asleep. So strike one, I'm annoyed with him being so anti social.

But the annoyance is compounded by the fact that he is doing behaviors that we have fought over many times...him not realizing he's not 19 anymore and now has kids and responsibilities. I found out last night that he made friends with a group of local kids who have been showing him the ""back hills"" where there are rocks and cliffs to jump off of, but this is off ski area so he has to ski down to the road and actually hitch hike back to the ski resort. I'm livid, literally seeing red, wanting to do terrible things to Him angry. 

This is bad enough but we have this same fight every time we go anywhere, whether it's surfing, mountain biking, rock climbing you name it...he's always pushing it. We have this same fight almost every week night because he goes to Brazilian jiu-jitsu and comes back with his knees tweaked or face all scratched up. I'm sick of this. 

In fairness to my husband he's a great dad and we had two kid much closer in age than we'd planned and he's very supportive and good at giving me breaks, but that makes his irresponsible behavior even more stark because I can't raise two small kids on my own if he kills himself flying down and mountain with no ski patrol (or surfing waves too big, etc...). And to add insult to injury, he says he can't wait to take our kids along on all his adventures as soon as they are old enough.

Like I said, I can't raise two small kids by myself. How do I get him to stop the nonsense and take his responsibilities seriously?
 


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Husband is taking ridiculous risks while doing his ""extreme sports"" I want him to stop because among other reasons, we have small kids.

Edit: this blew up, sorry I wasn‚Äôt around to participate‚Äîan ironic twist, I skied all day with my cousin and had such fun my husband actually beat me in.

To address the most common concerns;

1. We have a huge life insurance policy through my husbands work, as far as I know it covers everything but I need to look into. It‚Äôs part of his job so we actually pay very small premiums on it.

2. I chose to be a SAHM, I do miss my career sometimes (as evidenxed by my comment) but I love spending tome with both kids, my husband works very hard to give me this. Our first was planned and we‚Äôd hoped for several years between kids but things happen and it‚Äôs a little more stressful than I‚Äôd hoped but we love both kids.

3. My dad adores my husband and he‚Äôs an introvert like Gregory, so he‚Äôs to bed while the rest of us are talking late into the night. My dad loves hearing about all about Greg‚Äôs adventures so he‚Äôs happy paying. Which sucks for me because my own dad is not an advocate for my desires. 

Thank you for all the advice I have some reading to do. Hopefully I can update when we get home.

[update - I (28f) was very angry with my husband (31m) for taking extreme risks during skiing while we have two small kids. After the responses to that post and some more vacation events, I realized that I was unreasonable. I've apologized to him but reiterated my fears.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/rSw47fvfiE)  **Feb 21, 2016**

Here is the original:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7yn3jg/my_28m_husband_31m_of_6_years_takes_ridiculous/

So that post totally blew up. I posted it at like 7:30 Monday morning while the family was getting ready, got zero responses and went out skiing, by lunch time it had like 200 responses and by the time I got in that evening it was over 500. By far my biggest reddit post ever (mostly DIY and crafts stuff). I spent Monday night carefully reading every single response because there was a ton of value in all of them. 

One post stood out and I apologize to whoever made it that I can't mention it them by name, but essentially they said it appeared I was conflating two issues, my husband taking risks and him not being social on vacation. I guess in the interest of brevity I had left out some details, I found out about Gregory's back country skiing because he is essentially my dad's hero and my dad sat there like a star struck school girl while Gregory regaled him with tales of backcountry skiing with local teenagers and jumping off 20 foot cliffs into powder. I was deeply annoyed with Gregory because it was the first time he was social with anyone. We were on day 3 of the vacation and he had literally gone to bed at 8 every night to get up and ski. I was jealous of how much fun my brother's wife and my two cousin's spouses were so engaged with the family. So I conflated my annoyance with both him (and my dad frankly) for being anti-social and taking risks. The posts the other day really helped me realize that and I made it a point to be nicer to him. 

It also helped that Monday night my cousin's husband got rip roaring drunk in our condo and started cursing up blue streak. This with kids aged 1-10 all staying in the same relatively small space. He and my cousin had a extremely embarrassing and public fight that started inside and ended outside within earshot of the entire base area ""village."" It made me realize that no matter how annoyed I can get with Gregory and his desire to not be social on most occasions, he will never, ever put me through that which helped me gain some perspective. 

The yesterday afternoon as my cousin and her husband were getting ready to leave, he was acting like a jack ass while driving (he was probably wickedly hung over) in the parking lot and ended up sliding right into a snow bank, giving their new Lexus some significant body damage. He got out cursing and spewing in the parking lot all while basically standing like a helpless baby screaming at my cousin that she needed to ""call someone goddamnit."" Gregory and my Dad very calmly dug his car out of the snow, dug up some gravel for traction and then backed his car out. It took maybe 10 minutes. It made me realize that quite possibly, all of Gregory's experience in remote places while biking, skiing, bowhunting, etc... have taught him to be relaxed and knowledgeable in a high pressure situation and he just did what had to be done. I felt very lucky and felt very sorry for cousin. I was watching this very hungover, overweight man cry in the middle of a parking lot because ""that's a $6500 grill on that car!"" while my very attractive and in shape husband who doesn't drink was calmly digging the entire car out. 

Yesterday, morning I asked him if he would be willing to ski with me that day and he said absolutely, that he was hoping we would get at least one day together. So another strike on me for not communicating with him and assuming that he would see me as something of a ""burden"" to his ski day so I didn't even want to ask if he'd ski with me. We actually had a great time together and he's so experienced he actually taught me more than I probably ever would have gotten from a paid lesson. 

While we were on the chairlift that day, I very calmly brought up my concerns about the back country skiing, leaving me to watch the kids (on other vacations, as I've said my mom and aunt are on ""kid duty' this trip--though me and my brother's wife are watching the kids today while my mom and aunt ski) while he goes and does activities. He assured me that the back country skiing at this area was very safe but that in the future he would get all the equipment necessary (float coat, peeps) in order to reduce the risk and he said that he was sorry for leaving me to go surfing on our last trip and that he would try very hard to communicate before hand what his desires for any particular trip will be in advance and have it be a dialectic conversation with give and take vs him just assuming he can bolt off whenever the waves are big. I also said I was sorry for being so cold to him since the trip started but that I would appreciate him trying to hang out for a little longer each night. He said that it's thinly veiled secret that he can't stand my cousin's husband because he is constantly trying to ""one upping"" and ""talking down"" to Gregory for a myriad of reasons (they work in a similar field, so I guess there's something of a rivalry) and now that he's gone he will be more comfortable. So last night Gregory cooked steaks for everyone and stayed up a little later (8:30 is later right?) and chatted and seemed to have a good time. So today, since this was a planned day off for me to watch the kids, we agreed that he could meet his new friends really early so they could do some in area hiking before the lifts started and that he could stay out as late as he wanted if the snow was good. 

So basically all is good, I love my husband more than words can possibly say and I'm glad we had this time together because I think while we had relatively minor problems in the grand scheme of things, we are coming out healthier and happier for it. 

If I hadn't made my post Monday morning, I very well have made the rest of the vacation miserable for both of us. Thank you very much for all the all the help!

Lexus,NX,"Talk me out of a Lexus NX | I'm looking at purchasing a new vehicle.  

I don't need one, I want one.  And I only want one cause I don't like my current car.  

I think I've determined I want an SUV, and I think I want a luxury SUV.  I've never had a 'nice' car before though.  I've always driven sports cars or jeeps.  

But I dont want/need a sports car anymore.  I still like to have fun while driving, but not being able to is fine too.  I'd rather be comfortable than have a car I can take 80mph through the corners, cause realistically I just don't do that anymore.  



Soooo... I've been looking at SUV's.  I don't need a huge one.  I have dogs.  No kids.  Just need a backseat and some room with the seats down to carry stuff when it comes up occasionally.  

I've gone on some test drives.  I drove an Acura RDX, Nissan Murano, Lexus NX, BMW i3, Ioniq 5.  Tried to find a Genesis GV70, but couldn't find any to even look at on the lot.  

I'm not sure what others are looking at.  Of them all, I think I'm leaning Lexus.  The inside seemed the nicest.  It drive super comfy, and the technology seemed really nice (loved the huge screen they had and the way it was integrated into the dash).  

The BMW drove fantastic for an SUV, I was impressed, by the interior was meh.  RDX was good, but I HATED the location of the wireless phone charger.  The Murano was garbage compared to the others, and it was similarly priced.  Don't understand why those would ever sell at that price.  


I'm not sure what else I should be considering.  I am having a hard time convincing myself to get a Lexus, despite the fact that I think I liked it the most.  

Talk me out of it.  Talk me into it.  Whatcha got?

Lexus,RC 300h,"Lexus RC series. Waar vind ik de 350? | Ik heb inmiddels een poos zitten sparen om een keer een leuke auto te kopen waar ik een tijdje plezier van kan hebben voordat ik het vader met volvo leven tegemoet ga. Eerst had ik een oogje op de Mercedes w218, maar toen maakte ik kennis met de Lexus RC350. Ik was op slag verliefd. Alles wat ik eigenlijk zoek in een auto zit in die RC350.

Mazda,CX-30,"So..did I fuck up? Mazda CX-30 | After weeks of looking at cars with my wife, mainly online, we went out yesterday to finally try to decide on a car and buy it. Had done a fair bit of research on the models we were looking at, Corollas, Mazda 2 and 3s, CX3, swift sports, etc. Our selection of cars from just online research had got out of hand so we decided we needed to go drive a few and decide. (Context- we have 4 kids, both work full time, only have a single car (the Staria 8 seater) and needed something for my wife‚Äôs new job that required quite a bit of travel). Getting out together without the 2 little kids is super hard so we got a babysitter in and spent the Saturday trying to fulfill the mission!

I‚Äôd used the redriven YouTube channel quite a bit and old mate on there raved about the CX-3, so when my wife saw some CX-30s which were a little bigger and really nice inside, I assumed they would be just as good and we bought one. Drove really well on the test drive, overall seemed pretty good, had 67,000 kms and was an Astina with the 2l engine so seemed to have all the good stuff. And as it‚Äôs apparently basically a 3 on stilts , i assumed it inherited the same reputational heritage.

Watched the redriven review on the CX30 (which is only 3 weeks old and wasn‚Äôt around when I was doing my initial research) and yeah- they kinda ripped it to shreds and recommended against buying one, citing quality issues with finish, paint, rattles, electrical issues, and even engine oil consumption, dilution issues etc.

Mazda,CX-5,"Please read this before you buy the Mazda CX-5 everyone is pushing - POV of a previous owner | I‚Äôve only ever owned 2 car brands, Mazda and Toyota. 

Drove a 2019 Mazda 3 then switched to a 2011 Toyota RAV4 when AWD became more necessary for me - I wanted to love the RAV4 for its boots strapped utility and reliability but I couldn‚Äôt last more than 1.5 years with it after the Mazda 3. 

Once I figured out that I wanted a Mazda again I settled on a 2018 CX-5 GT for all the reasons everyone else gets a Mazda. 

- Simple powertrain - naturally aspirated & 6 speed transmission 

- Leather seats, premium speakers, adaptive cruise control and automatic headlights were all *chefs kiss* at an affordable price 

- Good looking, nice lines (except for the rear) 

- Great handling for a crossover, I never doubted my ability to take a tight turn at high speeds

- Safe - the ‚ÄúBreak‚Äù notification saved me multiple occasions, like I avoided major accidents. 

But then came the bad:

- Build quality - after owning it for 2 years the car started looking super worn. Steering wheel was disintegrating, drivers seat ripped, windshield chipped easily, paint chips everywhere, piano black trim scratched. 

- Alternator failed at 100K Miles (happens but annoying)

- Power lift gate failed - apparently it‚Äôs somewhat common in colder climates for ice to get dislodged in the trunk panel seams. Opened it one cold night and the trunk totally misaligned, stopped opening fully, a $2,500 repair job according to Mazda. 

- Jerky transmission that feels like impending doom, the transmission on this vehicle is the worst and most indecisive I‚Äôve ever experienced. Every time I loaned my car out someone would ask if my transmission was ok. 

- Fuel economy is weak compared to competitors. 

- Depreciation hits hard-ish 

- Rattles as it ages, specifically caused by the Subwoofer

- Gas tank is wayyy too small, like seriously. 

- rear reflectors broke out of place, both 

All this to say I believe Mazda is the interim car you get when you don‚Äôt know what to get but you want to play it safe. You don‚Äôt want a RAV4/CRV, you have champagne taste with a beer budget so the better equipped German trims are out so you settle on the cheapest, best equipped, good reputation vehicle you can feel safe about, a CX5. 

You‚Äôll buy this car for logical reasons but emotionally you‚Äôll always wonder, as it ages, what should you trade it in for. 

I finally traded the CX-5 with all of the aforementioned issues once the repairs = 33% of my trade in-value for a 2016 4Runner, while it‚Äôs a different class of vehicle I‚Äôm amazed by how new the interior and body is after 8 years of being on the road and also how well they hold their value. 

This is what keeps me going back to Toyota. Their vehicles are honest and extremely well engineered with immaculate quality.  | I don‚Äôt know what kind of torture test OP put his cx-5 through cause my 2015 Mazda 6 looks and drives almost like new still. That includes the interior leather - no rips and steering wheel- no wear showing.",,,,,,,
Mazda,CX-7,"Hi. Former Mazda master tech here...  | Due to the fact I'm getting tons of repeating PMs, and see many repeating posts, I decided I'll make a post that covers many known issues\facts about the CX-5. This way, I can just link it. 
Yes, I might forget something, but that's because I'm human. I've seen about 40K work orders of Mazda's, and about 10K of those were mine to take care of. I can not comment on the diesel models, since I've never seen one. I'll be talking in miles because Americans usually have more problems with conversions than the rest of us... But I prefer metric.


1. ""Which CX-5 is the most reliable one?"" 
 2016.5 and 2017. Older are also great, but the 2016.5 and 2017 are the latest models with ""tank reliability"". This is due to the fact they don't have cylinder deactivation or i-stop, and no LED headlights\taillights (depends on trim, all have LED headlights, but some have auto level and tail lights). The headlights are about $1K each if they go out! Some lower trims of 2018+ also don't have CDA, and those will be reliable as well. Some early batch 2024s are also CDA (cylinder deactivation) free. 
Turbos (of any car) are less reliable than naturally aspirated CDA-free Mazda's, but might be more reliable than naturally aspirated Mazda's with CDA (more on that later). When you have a part that spins at 200,000 RPM, you can't expect the reliability of something that doesn't have that part.


2. Mazda OEM brakes are crap. Most of you will experience squeals and screeches. They're not bad at stopping, just noisy. So when you need brakes done eventually, switch to Brembo rotors and Akebono pads. If Brembo isn't available in your market, any mid-range and coated aftermarket rotors will still be better than Mazda's OEM... But I'll have to insist on the Akebono pads. Go on RockAuto and search for your model. Pretty much everything on the ""daily driver"" or ""premium"" categories will be much quieter than OEM. I prefer Akebono pads because (in my experience, and I haven't tried everything), their hardware fits the best.


3. Most common issue (all CX-5s, and all Mazdas in general) is the infotainment.
 CMUs are pretty rare (I've seen 4 in 7.5 years). Most of the time it's either an SD card, which creates bootloops (can be solved with a $30 SD card on Amazon) or a full screen screen (ghost touches, can be solved with a new screen for $150 at the junkyard, or just do this: https://youtu.be/wO9IQoH_2jQ). SD cards and screens I've seen going bad at least once every 2 weeks (on a slow week).


4. Got a transmission you think is acting up? Do this before going to a shop: 
https://youtu.be/TxU0y1DqTUc
In my experience, this will solve it over 80% of the times. 


5. ""How to maintain my CX-5 so it'll last?""  Transmission+differential+transfer case fluid every 50K miles (remember, there is no such thing as ""lifetime fluid"", manufacturer says there is just because of EPA and CAFE standards, so they could show that maintaining the vehicle requires less crude oil products... For them, ""lifetime""  means the lifetime of the warranty period), coolant flush every 5 years, brake fluid every 5-10 years, oil change every 5K miles at most (with none-turbo) and 3K with turbos (unless you want your engine to start burning oil early), spark plugs every 60K miles (none-turbo) and 35K turbo at most, to keep your coils healthy. Replace your engine air filter and cabin filter every year, regardless... Your MAF sensor and blower fan will thank you for it, and the better mileage you'll get from a new engine filter will pay for itself (if you'll do it by yourself, which is a 3 minute job)... Do the cabin filter yourselves too. Both air and cabin filters you can go aftermarket, because you replace them frequently. Don't get high flow filters, or filters that are too restrictive. See this: https://youtu.be/sJ3L-E-ufYo

Get yourself a $5-$10 brake fluid tester on Amazon\AliExpress, and a $10 coolant gravity tester+a $15 cheap multimeter, and test your own fluids... It only takes a few seconds, and no one will scam you to replace them ahead of time. [Here's](https://youtu.be/sxQ2zHHZfoI) how to test your coolant with a multimeter.
 

Walnut blasting intake valves every 70K miles. Fuel system cleaner with high PEA content (Chevron Techron, redline, or Gumout All-In-One) every 8K miles, preferably add it just before a long (100+ miles drive). Keep your fuel tank at least 1\4 full at all times, to keep the pump cool. This will extend its useful life by a huge factor.

Using 100% synthetic (different from ""full synthetic"") engine oil, you don't need to track time, only mileage. Best will be Pennzoil Platinum, which is derived from natural gas and not crude oil. 
See this: 
https://youtu.be/7hJU112oUg8


6. ""I don't like my tires"". Yes, those aren't great as well... Just use them up and get better tires, or get a better set and sell the old ones on FB marketplace. 

Overall, Mazda's reliability (even later models) is still top 3-5 (depending which year ranking), and are still one of the best vehicles you'll get for what they cost (in terms of reliability, dynamics, and premium interior and accessories).

7. I prefer helping out with individual issues in a public thread, so others could find it when searching online for the same issue, so please either comment or make a post, and only then PM me with the post link, and then I'll help many, instead of one. 

8. ""Does my engine sounds weird?"". Watch this: 
https://youtu.be/cdjIF4jYQow

9. I can't help with ""is this a good price to buy this car?"", I was never on sales. I CAN help with ""is this a reasonable price for this service?"".

10. Never go to a dealership for anything! The only exception is complex diagnostics or warranty work. Go to a private shop that isn't a chain (a shop with only one location, maybe 2, in the entire country). Dealership are 2X more expensive, and the easy work (service) is done by the newest apprentices to ""learn"" on your vehicle, while the licensed techs are busy with diagnostics, complex work, PDIs, warranty, and safety certificates.

If you think I forgot something (which I probably have), please add it. 

11. Have a newer Mazda? Hate the app, the subscription model, and the fact the engine turns off when you open the door? Get [this](https://www.amazon.com/Start-X-Remote-Select-Mazdas-Lock-Unlock-Lock/dp/B09RQ2YGD7) one instead. Takes 15-20 minutes to assemble, and doesn't turn off unless you don't have the fob with you when you press on the brake pedal.

Edit: ""Will this hold true with other models?"" 
Yes. But the years\trims that have CDA will be different. Anything else powertrain and infotainment related is the same.

Edit: Wow, I had no idea this was going to blow up like this. Give me 6-8 weeks to try and respond to all the inquiries, and update the list with the suggestions that you reminded me of. 
 

12. ""how to tell if I have cylinder deactivation?""
Under fuel economy in the infotainment system 
https://youtu.be/-JAlBM-31k8
Also, if you have [this](https://imgur.com/a/15LhkLw) part on your exhaust, you got CDA.
BTW, if you have a screeching\whistling noise when you start up or turn off the car, that's the part that's doing that. It doesn't mean it has to be replaced, just mean it's slightly worn. If you're under warranty, get it replaced. If you're out of warranty, wait for your engine light to turn on before you replace it.

Edit : if I haven't answered your question, it probably means someone else already asked it and it was answered. I'm going through all the comments, and now it's YOUR turn üòè but I'm still trying to answer even repeating questions, they just go to the end of the line, since there are hundreds to answer. PMs will be the last to be answered (but they will eventually), since that only helps one person, and not everyone. 

13. Someone reminded me of another known issue, which is mirrors not folding or making creeking noise when folding. This is usually the mirror motor assembly, not an easy diy or a cheap job. About $200-$250 per side. And this one you should go to the dealer for... It's very easy to break a few things if you do it incorrectly. 
Some people say lubricating works, but in my experience, it worked only about 20% of the times. But you have nothing to lose by trying, so here you go: 
https://youtu.be/NTZZUBafZgs

Edit: ""If I have to choose between a 2024 with CDA or 2024 turbo, which should I choose"". Well, I don't have enough data, as there's not enough mileage on those to see long term reliability, but If I was a betting man, I would go for the turbo. Turbo problems can be delayed with more vigorous maintenance (short interval oil changes), CDA problems are uncontrollable. But again, it's just an educated guess, so take it with a large grain of salt. 

14. Another issue one commented reminded me of is ""sticky"" command console control buttons and joystick. This is usually caused from liquid damage, as those are stupidly placed next to the cup holders. Try this: 
Buy ""electrical contactor spray"". Take out the battery negative terminal, spray a huge amount (1\4 to 1\2 of the can) of contactor spray on the buttons and bottom of the joystick, while you press and play with them. Then wait 5 minutes. Do that again, wait 10 minutes, reconnect the battery, start the car and check if it worked. Repeat if\when necessary.

15. Another known issue is the coolant valve (Mazda's fancy word for thermostat). Not very common, but not rare either. They are quite expensive though (about $700 all in). The good news are that there a cheaper fix than what the dealership tell you. Insist paying the labor hours stated in the TSB!

Edit for companies PMing me: No, I will not put an affiliate link or promote your product, not even if it's one that I recommended here already. There are 2 reasons for this... 
A. It will ruin the integrity of my post\recommendations. 
B. What if tomorrow your product isn't good anymore, and I want to edit the post and recommend something else? I won't be able to do it, since I'm getting money from you. Reddit is to help people, not to become another breeding ground for greedy ""influencers"" like ticktock or Instagram. If I wanted to sell stuff to people, I would've stayed at the dealership! So please stop approaching me.

Edit: a commenter question reminded me: Wheel alignment ISN'T MAINTENANCE. Don't let them sell you that! You only need wheel alignment if you replace a suspension part that requires it, or when your tires show irregular wear, or if your car doesn't track straight.

Edit: apparently people are not happy with the shorter explanation version of why CDA is bad (for all manufacturers), so here's the long one: Thermodynamics. When you turn off two cylinders and the two others are firing, it means two cylinders are running colder than the other two. All cylinders share the same block and cylinder head. When some parts of the cylinder head are colder than other parts, the rate of expansion and contraction is different between areas of the same block of metal.
Those stresses, in turn, can lead to either micro fractures in the head (cracked cylinder head eventually), or out of round of the bores (oil consumption eventually). This isn't just a Mazda problem, it's a problem with other manufacturers as well. Search ""Chevrolet cylinder deactivation issues"", or ""Honda VCM issues"" and see. Same issues across the board. 

Edit for new owners: Do an oil change after the first 1000-1500 miles. No... Engines aren't really ""broken in"" at the factory. See this: 
https://youtu.be/X4424Q5lLR8

Edit for fellow Redditors:
 Please don't give me ""awards"" (unless you get them for free somehow). Donate that amount to what you think is a worthy cause. Writing ""thank you, that was helpful"" in the comments makes me much happier than getting an award. Reddit is a 20 billion dollars behemoth... They don't need your money, as they make enough from ads.


Edit for mods\general Redditors: I'll answer here because I was asked several times. Yes, you can copy my post and put it in any forum\sub you want. You don't need to give me credit or get my permission. It's nice that you ask... But you don't need to. The more people know about this, the better. Doesn't matter if it's from me or from you.

Mazda,MX-5,"Mazda MX-5 as a daily? | Hi all,

I‚Äôve recently had an epiphany (or an early mid-life crisis in my late 20s) and have come to the realisation that I am driving a 5-seater Fiesta ST-Line and spend 95% of my driving using one of the seats, 4% using 2 of the seats when out with the gf and 1% using any of the back seats/boot space with seats down.

So I‚Äôve been very heavily drawn to trading in my Fiesta for an MX-5, likely 15‚Äô plate or later.

I was just wondering what is it like as a daily driver? I commute 5x days a week around 30 miles total (mix of back b roads and dual carriageways) and my route can get quite flooded when rain is bad as it has been recently - should I be concerned using it all through the winter?

Cheers!

Edit: Thanks all for your comments and advice, I‚Äôm booking in a test drive this weekend ! | The biggest issue is salt ime, keep it well washed in the winter especially when the roads are salty. 

They're light cars so care should be taken on flooded roads as they can aquaplane quite easily, good tyres help a lot. They can deal with big puddles just like any small car really, the intake (on mk1s atleast) are quite high in the engine bay. I wouldn't recommend fording one though..

Should be a bit better if it snows than a fiesta being RWD but take it easy, it will tail slide. 

Edit, I don't really know what the mk4s are like rust wise, but I think mx5 and winter, I think rust.",,,,,,,
Mazda,Mazda2,"They still sell mazda2 sedan (iA?) outside of US. How does its handling compare to Miata? It‚Äôs the lightest vehicle from Mazda sfter Miata. It has to have Miata elements | Sure, it's not a speed king or will be considered a performance car. But it's still a light weight agile car for half the price of Miata. From the same people. 

As far as handling and driving dynamics, at least on paper it can be a poor man's Miata.

Like how you can get a ghetto Big Mac by adding the Big Mac ingredients to a McDouble for much less cost. Or a dominoes specialty pizza by adding the same toppings to a pizza and applying a coupon.

So how does this car handle? For those who've driven both how is it  | I had a DJ Mazda 2 hatch with a manual box for about 9 years - which is the same car sold everywhere else outside the USA.

It's a fun little car to drive, especially with a manual (shifts really well). The steering feel is good and it generally feels pretty nimble like most small cars do. Earlier models are noisy and crashy, but the ride and NVH got a big improvement with the first major facelift about 5 years ago.

It's not a fast car by any means, though and comes with narrow 185 tires, so you reach the limits of grip pretty quickly. I've never tracked mine, but it doesn't feel like it would be suitable without some proper suspension mods and better tires.

It has fairly poor traction in the wet and poor surfaces, where it spins its wheels waaay too easily especially on an incline or a corner - more so than most other FWD hatches I've driven.

So it's a fun commuter car, but definitely not a Miata hatch when stock. Something like a Suzuki Swift Sport would be a lot more entertaining out of the box. But I like the way it looks, and it always put a smile on my face when I was behind the wheel.",,,,,,,
Mazda,Mazda3,"Fair deal? 2015 Mazda 3 I Touring $11k @ 95k miles | I need a car for at least the next 1.5 years as I might be moving. Is this a good deal keeping resale value in mind? 

Minor damage | That's a lot of owners for so few miles. I'd say no.",,,,,,,
Mazda,Mazda5,"Thoughts on the Mazda Mazda5 Mini Minivan? | Been looking into getting something bigger than the standard hatchback/sedan sized vehicle, budget is not high but I fully intend on finding the cheapest one near me and fixing it up if it's worth it. 

From what I can see, to get a running and driving Mazda5 anywhere between 2-5k, but majority of the listing's I have seen don't mention any particular damage aside from maybe an 02 sensor, a/c not running, or just dents and dings.

I like the idea of the efficienct 4 cylinder, sounds like tune up (sparks / coil packs) would be cheap and easy to replace, looks like the tires are not too expensive, suspension sets are around 500-700$ for the parts for decent sets, and overall it just seems like an easy car to own.

I have no idea what insurance rates might be on it, but I can't imagine they would be insane. 

Any thought from yall? I would love to hear feedback from any owners or friends of owners as well, thank you in advanced.  | I‚Äôm probably too late on this, but I purchased a new 2010 Mazda 5 in 2011, used it for its intended purpose of hauling kids to school and practice including carpools with extra kids. It was perfect for the urban environment I‚Äôm in. Since the kids left the house, I went all in on the utility hauler iteration, removing the enter row seats, cutting some old carpet for the floor, and using as my surfboard and bike hauler, road trip worthy daily driver. These cars are known to have some problems with the suspension and I just had to have the clutch and transaxle and a motor mount replaced, along with a major tune up. But considering the hard driving I‚Äôve put it through over the last 14 years, I can‚Äôt complain about the cost. The sliding doors are awesome especially with kids, but regardless. The mileage on mine was not great.  Mine has the manual transmission.  I like the utility of being able to things like a 9‚Äô longboard inside, since it would get stolen off the roof rack otherwise. And it‚Äôs been amazing for moving, and a limo feel in the otherwise cramped rear seats, with the center seats removed, but I digress‚Ä¶.",,,,,,,
Mazda,Mazda6,New Mazda EZ-6 Is China‚Äôs Electric Mazda6 Sedan | That grill is pretty damn weird. I like everything else.,,,,,,,
Mazda,RX-8,"r/RX8 - Should you premix Mazda RX-8 Series 2 model(09-13)? | I currently own a 2009 Mazda RX-8 GT. 130,000 miles and being rebuilt by Lucky7racing right now. Once it‚Äôs rebuilt, I‚Äôm debating if I should premix. I‚Äôve seen sooooo much info on the S1 but little to no one talks about the much better and improved S2 RX-8 which had the improved oiling in the engine. The question stands, should you still premix the series 2 RX-8? And if so, how much should you premix? And why that ratio?? | I would advise to go light on premix if you don‚Äôt drive your car hard. Or you still have a cat. Because I‚Äôve known that it would cause excessive carbon buildup if too much premix is put in, and that‚Äôs especially true for s2 rx8 since if your not driving hard I think there is no point in putting more then 100ml per tank of premix in. As the factory OMP Is pretty decent since they added extra port and made it electronically controlled. 

So for me and my research.

S2 I would do 100ml of premix per full tank for city driving where you can‚Äôt punch the throttle (like there is no highway and your just sitting in traffic jammed)
200ml if your driving hard(I don‚Äôt mean race track but like punch the throttle when you go on highways and stuff just have fun)

Do note I actually have seen two engines with exact opposite conditions 

My personal r3 has always been premixed by the previous owner and lasted 140000miles and still had 80psi on front rotor, 60 psi on rear due to cracked side seals. He has always driven the car very hard and redlined it constantly. When I took the engine apart there was no carbon buildup what's so ever only a little bit on the rotor faces.

recently just bought another r3 rx8 where the owner said he has never premixed ever and the engine lasted 150000 miles. And still had like 70psi of compression left over. Haven't taken it apart so I don't know how the carbon buildup is but I would expect slightly more as the owner said he didn't go that hard when driving it.So honestly up to you.

Though my sample size is low so take with a huge grain of salt. I'm sure there are way to qualified rebuilderes with more experience.

But personally I believe there is not much downside to premixing, as with case one where the engine lastest just as long on premix and had basically no carbon buildup.

On the condition that you do not have a cat and drive the car very hard. If you don't have those two conditions met then I would probably say you don't need premix and honestly should probablyndo a seafoam engine clean once in a while to ensure no carbon build up, because I've heard lots of engine die from carbon flaking off and cracking stuff.

But if you can bear the hassle and don‚Äôt have a cat, then you can technically just put like 400ml per tanks and do a sea foam carbon cleanup procedure every half a year if you are that worried about engine health. That should theoretically give you the most engine life, but for me that‚Äôs way too much hassle for no proven gains


TLDR 

You should premix if you drive your car hard and have no cat(my opinion) but don't premix if you have a cat and ur stuck in traffic.(Especially for S2 due to their better omp)",,,,,,,

Mercedes-Benz,B 150,"Why Clean energy is still the high IQ play in 2021. Solar, Hydrogen, Nuclear. DD Inside. | Why is energy still the play and why will it let you retire in the few years?

General: 
During a recession energy consumption always decreases relatively, and even more so with Covid, due to lack of office spaces, lack of recreation, and lack of travel / commute. You can look back at the ‚Äò08 ‚Äò09 crisis and view how energy and c02 emissions skyrocketed after Michael Burry got famous. [1]
   
  

Next, we have the catalysts, Joe Biden. According to his administration there are only 9 years left to stop the worst consequences of climate change. Biden will act quickly, and aggressively. He‚Äôs working with Congress to enact in 2021 legislation and plans that will put America on an irreversible path to economy wide net zero emissions. While also rallying the rest of the world to pursue clean action through leadership and action. Not really lastly, but also make $400bn as ONE part of a broad mobilization of public investment in clean energy and innovation (relatively old news, but relevant) All while creating 10,000,000 new jobs in clean energy. This is within his ‚ÄúBiden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment‚Äù which also pertains to the auto industry such as EV gov vehicles, see WKHS as an example.[2][3]  
    

Energy has already gone up alot this last 6 months. It's too late! False. So has everything, even giants like Apple are up over 100% since March lows.   Clean energy has been supressed these last 4 years, and are only going back to where they belong.
  

Hydrogen: 
Recently Mercedes-Benz spins off it‚Äôs truck unit due to ever changing landscape in industrial and commercial vehicles. While premium sedans have largely been adopting the EV mantra, commercial trucking has seemed to go the way of hydrogen. ‚Äú..while the truck business is investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology. [6] Recently Ballad power Systems $BLDP signed a deal to make the hydrogen fuel cell for hydrogen power boats as well. [7]

  

Nuclear::
Now, we have Solar, Wind, Hydrogen and what else? Well, reasonably speaking you also have Uranium to Nuclear energy. Did you know that The world has largely put most of their uranium mines on hold and in maintenance mode? Right now there are 442 Nuclear Reactors operating within 30 countries, primarily in US, France, China, Russia and Japan (rip) this consume 200 MILLION pounds in Uranium per year. We are currently sitting at a 20 million pound deficit and could reach as high as 50 million pounds.     
  

Utilities have been underbuying Uranium since 2014 than they need to produce nuclear energy, the difference (or deficit) between what they are buying and what they need to produce Nuclear energy has been filled by drawdown of existing inventories. We also have Elon Musk talking about Nuclear Bull case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKH-uVqg9OI [4][5]
  



# If I had to choose a single ticker from each, I would choose **$FCEL** for Hydrogen, **$NXE** for Nuclear, **$ENPH** for solar

The tides in energy have changed, we are seeing huge pushes globally to adopt these new technologies. If you rub your couple of brain cells together really hard, this shit is the future.    

Tickers: $FCEL, $BLDP, $PLUG, $NXE, $ENPH or if you want ETFs, $TAN, $FAN, $PBW (shout out to $ICLN gang) 
  
Final: This was way longer and harder than I anticipated to put together. We still have Energy Storage, Wind, and I didn‚Äôt even address Solar reasons, Biofuels or NatGas. But these are my big bets for 2021. I'm aware EV is beast, but so is everyone else, bringing new information to light that may be less represented. 
I'll do a part2: if you enjoy this expanding and adding extra details.

Mercedes-Benz,C 200,"The Rise of Canoo ($GOEV) ‚Äì Why JPOW‚Äôs printer, Biden‚Äôs EV support ($15 billion in infrastructure bill, $160 billion in EV subsidies in budget), ~70% increase in institution ownership, 30+% SI and ~98% utilization are primed to send a young and unique EV manufacturer to the stratosphere. | Gather around folks, hope y‚Äôall made some gains the last time around. This DD is split into 8 parts, so feel free to jump to whichever section you‚Äôre most interested in.

**Part 2 ‚Äì Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**

**Part 3 ‚Äì Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**

**Part 4 ‚Äì Recent Updates**

**Part 5 ‚Äì Financials and Valuation**

**Part 7 ‚Äì SI and Squeeze Potential**

**Part 8 ‚Äì TL;DR**

**Part 1 ‚Äì Introduction**

It was a warm Monday morning on August 23rd almost a month back, when seemingly for no reason ‚Äì **GOEV shot up from ~$5.9 to ~$8, a 30% gain on the day.** The next day ‚Äì GME popped, for a 30% gain as well, with AMC and BB also making up big gains, leading to the ‚Äòmeme mania‚Äô we‚Äôve been experiencing for the last couple of weeks. 

Why‚Äôd this happen? Well there were no company/industry catalysts. The only event that seemed to occur in the prior week was the expiration of monthly options. One of the theories going around is that there‚Äôs an almost quarterly cycle going on at this point where FTD‚Äôs are leading to a surge in prices in the next cycle for ‚Äòmeme stocks‚Äô which tend to be heavily shorted for the most part. How accurate this is I have no clue and whether this applies to GOEV I don‚Äôt know, haven‚Äôt investigated that particular theory but there‚Äôs plenty of posts/comments floating around for you to look into if you‚Äôre so inclined. 

The quick point I‚Äôm trying to make here is that if a heavily shorted stock is popping 30% in a day, with no major catalyst for the industry or the company in question ‚Äì and that company is now advancing towards realizing its major milestones with favorable tailwinds expected for the sector, it could pop a lot more than 30% in the months to come. **GOEV is among the youngest EV companies - having been around for less than 5 years, with arguably the most unique vehicles coming out (on schedule ‚Äì seems to be pretty amazing in the EV space) that very few, if any, of the established or other up and coming competitors are producing, and has been shorted more it seems ‚Äì for the failure of its peers than any real fault of its own.**

**Part 2 ‚Äì Market Trends and Upcoming Catalysts**

* From an investment into equities point of view ‚Äì S&P 500 has fallen about 0.5%, on average, during the month of September. Stocks have tended to go up, on average, during every other month ‚Äî other than a slight dip in February ‚Äî over the past half century [link]( https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/01/investing/stock-market-september/index.html). However, this may soon be coming to an end as in the past week Investors stampeded into stocks and out of cash as global equity funds witnessed their biggest inflows since March 2021 while large-cap U.S. funds enjoyed a record haul, a weekly round-up by BofA showed. [link](https://www.investing.com/news/economy/monster-reallocations-to-stocks-as-us-tax-threat-recedes--bofa-2619022) 

* Let‚Äôs take a look at the EV market dynamics and upcoming catalysts before getting into GOEV specifically, so we get a high-level understanding of the bigger picture. The global EV market is expected to be valued at $725.1 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 27.19% from $171.26 in 2021 [source](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/electric-vehicle-market). This is expected to grow to $1.007 trillion by 2027 which is an average of 2 sources - [source 1](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/electric-vehicle-market-analysis-size-regional-outlook-competitive-strategies-and-forecasts-to-2027-2021-07-12?tesla=y), [source 2](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-market-size-to-be-valued-at-1-212-1-billion-by-2027-owing-to-rising-number-of-government-initiatives-globally-to-promote-manufacturing--adoption-of-evs--million-insights-301238118.html), another source actually has the market valued at $2.5 trillion but it‚Äôs a bit of an outlier compared to the other 2 [source 3](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/11/2227050/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-EV-Market-Worth-2-495-4-Billion-by-2027-Growing-at-a-CAGR-of-33-6-From-2020-Exclusive-Report-by-Meticulous-Research.html).   

* Global EV forecast is for a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent achieved over the next ten years: Total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  Despite the pressure exerted on the market by the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term outlook for EVs is strong. The significant shift in expected volume of BEVs and PHEVs by 2030 is based on four factors: consumer sentiment, policy and regulation, OEM strategy and the role of corporate companies. All four of these factors saw major changes in direction over the last year, prior to the emergence of COVID-19, and have since been shaped further by the pandemic. [link](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/electric-vehicle-trends-2030.html) 

* In November 2018, an article came out stating that the number of EVs on U.S. roads was projected to reach 18.7 million in 2030, up from 1 million at the end of 2018. This is about 7 percent of the 259 million vehicles (cars and light trucks) expected to be on U.S. roads in 2030. Annual sales of EVs will exceed 3.5 million vehicles in 2030, reaching more than 20 percent of annual vehicle sales in 2030. About 9.6 million charge ports will be required to support 18.7 million EVs in 2030. This represents a significant investment in EV charging infrastructure. [link]( https://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/newsroom/Pages/Press%20Releases/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx). 

* As it turns out, that number of annual EV sales of 3.5 million vehicles in 2030 was revised to almost double of that in a November 2020 report, just 2 years after the previous article. The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. Over 90% of states offered incentives for setting up EV charging infrastructure, with meaningful quality of life incentives and exemptions are offered across 39 states in the US, including easier payment plans for the purchase of EVs, limited-time incentives to accelerate EV adoption/conversion and lack of requirements for emission inspections across several states. [link]( https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/111920-us-ev-market-sales-to-rise-to-69-million-units-by-2025-frost-amp-sullivan)

* President Biden is seeking a pledge from auto manufacturers that would see EVs make up 40% - 50% of new U.S. vehicle sales by 2030 [link 1](https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/40-percent-evs-2030/), [link 2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-set-target-50-evs-by-2030-industry-backs-goal-2021-08-05/) which is double of the 20% forecast just three years earlier in 2018, and would likely occur only with strong support on the supply side through infrastructural and other support that would enable EV manufacturers to develop the capacity to produce the target number of vehicles, and demand side with respect to incentivizing people to purchase EVs. 

* EV tax credits jump to $12,500 in proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. This bill adds $4,500 to the current $7,500 tax credit available for a total of $12,500 potentially available to EV buyers. It includes passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The proposal calls for $160 billion to fund subsidies and purchase incentives, EV charging infrastructure funding, EV manufacturing incentives, federal EV procurement requirements, and incentives to electrify heavy-duty commercial fleets. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ev-tax-credit-bill-biden/) 

* The proposed EV credits in the budget blueprint would last for 10 years and consumers would be allowed to deduct the value of the credit from the sales price at the time of purchase. In 2027, the $7,500 credit would only apply to U.S.-made vehicles. It would also create a new smaller credit for used EVs of up to $2,500. There are also lower credits for EVs with smaller battery packs. The bill says individual taxpayers must have an adjusted gross income of no more than $400,000 to get the new EV tax credit. It would limit the EV credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000, while trucks could be priced up to $74,000. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/11/us-democrats-propose-dramatic-expansion-of-ev-tax-credits-that-favors-big-three.html) 

* Furthermore, the bipartisan infrastructure plan, titled the American Jobs Plan, includes billions of dollars for other electrification efforts and for a national charging network. Specifically, the bipartisan plan includes $7.5 billion for a network of EV charging stations across the country. It also includes another $7.5 billion for electric buses and other transportation methods. [link](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/biden-infrastructure-ev-subsidies-charging-network/)  

* States area also providing EV incentives to residents e.g. Gov. JB Pritzker signed Illinois‚Äô clean energy law which includes a $4,000 rebate for residents to buy an electric vehicle (EV). [link](https://www.mystateline.com/news/local-news/illinois-wants-to-give-you-4000-to-buy-an-electric-vehicle/). 

* By 2030, there‚Äôs expected to be an 8% divergence between EV demand estimates and production plans, meaning there needs to be a massive scaling up of infrastructure/capacity of EV manufacturers over current projections in order to fill the gap in the market.

**Part 2 ‚Äì Company Overview and Unique Value Proposition**

**Before we look into what‚Äôs happened since my last post, let‚Äôs go over a quick refresher on what the company does.** Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 650 employees [link](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/65/canoo-receives-initial-aa-esg-leader-rating-from-msci) from leading technology and automotive companies [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/). Canoo‚Äôs Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else‚Äôs lineup‚Ä¶ take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=1747). What makes this Canoo so special compared to other EVs is their modular platform, which is purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. 

It is this modular platform that led to Apple‚Äôs interest and having talks with Canoo (the talks are assumed to have fallen apart because Canoo was looking for an investor while Apple was looking to for an acquisition), as the platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car‚Äôs electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev).

Apple wasn‚Äôt the only major company interested in Canoo, Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai and Kia‚Äôs parent company) actually went a lot farther than Apple did with Canoo, announcing a partnership in February 2020 to develop new electric vehicles based on the technological platform developed by Canoo [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). This was extremely unusual and referred to as a significant victory for Canoo, as ‚Äòpretty much every electric vehicle startup has talked about wanting to license out their technology or partner with legacy automakers, almost none have landed a deal‚Ä¶ Canoo now joins that small list despite only coming into existence at the end of 2017, when its founders started the company‚Äô [link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia). 

Ultimately this partnership did not go ahead because Canoo‚Äôs chairman didn‚Äôt feel as though it was worth it for Canoo, saying that the original deal with Hyundai didn‚Äôt factor in the value of Canoo‚Äôs IP, so a shift in strategy was made from licensing out the technology to protecting the IP and manufacturing and selling Canoo‚Äôs own vehicles to commercial operators [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev) 

Regarding the technology/IP - Canoo has developed the world‚Äôs flattest skateboard platform, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. For example, the lifestyle vehicle, which will offer the interior space of a large SUV, but on the exterior footprint of a compact car. To help achieve this, Canoo‚Äôs suspension utilizes a double wishbone with two fiberglass leaf springs, mounted transversely in the front and rear of the platform. The dampers are mounted to the frame, eliminating the need for large shock towers that take up vital cabin space. The entire suspension system is incorporated into the skateboard and sits below the height of the tires. [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video).

Let‚Äôs take a look at the current automotive model and see how Canoo‚Äôs approach and the use of the skateboard platform add so much more value than conventional ICE manufacturers [link](https://gyazo.com/041f5f426804ab087740da6c5b0b1aeb), currently the model is broken because 70-80% of the portion of vehicle lifetime profit is only generated after the first owner. The current model is geared towards the first owner and nothing more, with an assortment of OEMs/spare parts retailers/3rd party installers servicing vehicles after the initial sale. Canoo aims to change this by targeting multiple owners after the first purchase i.e. owners 2-4, offering customers the ability to upgrade the model of whichever vehicle they have or switch them entirely as the platform on which the vehicles are built is the same [link](https://gyazo.com/272959d52f3e8c169c711e9b18dbd98c). 

The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions [link](https://gyazo.com/7ade9dac03f0e6fcbffc6b8f3942eb4c), with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo‚Äôs vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next. It‚Äôs also worth pointing out that in traditional ICE, it would be exceptional if Bill of Materials cost carryover across variants reached 25%, with Canoo, this is exceeding 50%. The specific savings include:

* 45% - 55% labor savings for new variants developed

* 57% of the BOM cost carryover across variants

* >70% of critical functions are delivered by the platform.

These enable the development of space efficient cabins that integrate simply onto platform [link](https://gyazo.com/0a5777ed4387d9d9916a0c0d949f452e), and provide the key basis for engineering Canoo‚Äôs new value proposition of having a harmonized and articulated 3 ‚Äì layer vehicle concept that keeps fresh and returns capital over an entire vehicle lifecycle [link](https://gyazo.com/7992fbead2e3c724ec002333b8c909c8). This image also showcases how Canoo aims to capture the full vehicle lifecycle value [link](https://gyazo.com/ca0abdaece1006dbb34ad42b60bb2977) 

The three vehicles that Canoo has publicly announced as part of its lineup are:

Lifestyle vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/) - Fully electric, highly versatile and offering more utility inside and out for city explorers, businesses, families and adventurers. The multi-purpose platform unlocks SUV-size interior space on a smaller exterior footprint. It‚Äôs pretty hard to put into an image of the vehicle into words so I‚Äôd recommend clicking on the above link to check it out for yourself. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):

* Launching late 2022.

* Starting at $34,750*

* 2 seats - 5 seats - 7 seats

* 250 mi range

* Up to 350 Horsepower 

* 28min charge time 80%

* 188 ft¬≥ interior volume

* 80 KWh battery

* 1,464 lbs payload ‚Äì 2,000 lbs capacity

Multi-purpose Delivery Vehicle [link](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) ‚Äì Business ready vehicle that lowers the total cost of ownership while providing easy maintenance. More cargo in a small footprint to enable easy maneuverability. A productivity tool that enables you to plug in your tools and get to work. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):

* Starting at $33,000*

* 200 ft¬≥ - 500 ft¬≥ cargo volume

* 130 ‚Äì 230 mi, 90 ‚Äì 190 mi range (EPA)

* 1,540 to 1,980 lbs

Pickup [link](https://www.canoo.com/pickup/) ‚Äì All Electric, All American, All Utility - The Pickup Truck is built to be the new standard in function, form and utility ‚Äî ready for work and the weekend. The picup truck is as strong as the toughest trucks out there and includes features for people who use trucks on the job, weekend, and adventure. Some key figures (note the range provided in certain cases is for the variants):

* Launching as early as 2023.

* Price ‚Äì Not currently listed, but during the Q&A portion of the investor day portion on June 30th, somebody asked what the base pricing for the pickup was, given that the Ford lightning F-150 base price was being advertised at $32,000. Chairman Tony Aquila said Canoo was not prepared to announce the pricing at that time, but Canoo would not be beaten in this category ‚Äì you can check it out at the following link [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=10908)  

* Targeted HP ‚Äì 500+

* Payload Capacity ‚Äì 1800 lbs

* Range ‚Äì 200+ mi

* Powertrain ‚Äì AWD or RWD

There‚Äôs actually a fourth vehicle as well that hasn‚Äôt been listed anywhere officially but was found by /u/Mcardiel007 when he was having issues communicating with Canoo and went to their Torrance location and spotted them unloading what is potentially the new sedan. All credits to him/her for the following pictures [pic 1](https://gyazo.com/5e84005c8399352f2de9efbedeb3d933), [pic 2](https://gyazo.com/608a14d42df52284544bfbf0cf4a2912?token=1800737b805fc34222e29805d032b29c), [pic 3](https://gyazo.com/906b46f350bed3e4ed10357422bf548a), [pic 4](https://gyazo.com/5dd4b620f07fcb72fdb2234dfc35a36a), [pic 5](https://gyazo.com/83e23a1219e08bd6a2d118138121a714). 

We can see that Canoo is targeting the most attractive segments at a lower incremental cost. The most profitable and highest carbon dioxide emitting segments are pickups and SUVs, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup). One of the fastest growing segments is delivery vans, with ~2M more delivery vehicles needed globally by 2030 [link](https://gyazo.com/309703e692c4a4fa96cd91096b593ac4). It‚Äôs important to keep in mind existing fleet conversion to EV as well. Using the common platform provides a pivot-ability to focus on high margin products and is a large and profitable opportunity ‚Äì highly lucrative and accretive to overall margin [link](https://gyazo.com/51a7448bc7b0c236d6c4b528eb662dda). 

Canoo is also looking at car data and not just strictly being a vehicle manufacturer ‚Äì with an opportunity for harmonizing hardware and software + superior cleaning leading to actionable data instead of the status quo of outsourced hardware + poor cleaning leading to disjointed data. Each connected vehicle offers 1 ‚Äì 2 TB of raw data per day, with car data monetization globally valued at $250 Billion - $400 Billion [link](https://gyazo.com/d1e6a55ce2f1bb3777020592281afe8f).

To sum it up ‚Äì Canoo is well-positioned for success with a differentiated business model [link](https://gyazo.com/6b0ce0f9af42b090b04e970aafe696fe), developing exceptional products that are aimed at the most profitable segments ($115B+ for 90% 2020 profit pool) in the US, addressing upfitting and accessories market in the US by monetizing full vehicle lifetime value with emphasis on 2nd, 3rd and 4th customers (valued at $24B+), and monetization of car data globally through customer-centric, software ecosystem generating exponential network effect ($250B+).

**Part 4 ‚Äì Recent Updates**

**Now let‚Äôs take a look at some of the hires that the company‚Äôs been making (note that almost all of these hires have happened since the last quarter, with most being in the last two months, and this is not an exhaustive list).

**Now why on earth would these long-established and assumingly well-reputed individuals with executive level careers at places including the United Nations, U.S. Department of State, Nio, Tesla, Fiat Chrysler, Daimler AG/Mercedez-Benz, General Motors, Nissan, Toyota, Hyundai, Honda, Salesforce, NASA, McAfee, PepsiCo, Samsung, Harley-Davidson etc. move to an upstart EV manufacturer within the last couple of months if they didn‚Äôt believe in it‚Äôs potential for success? Some of these individuals have spent 5-10 years with their prior companies, it doesn‚Äôt make sense that they‚Äôd all be jumping over to Canoo for a 1 year engagement.**

Other than the talent, Canoo has made a number of moves in in recent months as it moves closer to bringing the first of the Lifestyle Vehicles to production, including:

Announcing plans to build its new factory outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma, creating more than 2,000 jobs and opening in 2023. The facility will be built on a 400-acre site at the MidAmerica Industrial Park complex in Pryor, Oklahoma. It will house a paint shop, body shop, and general assembly plant. Oklahoma is providing an incentive package that totals over $300 million, and may kick in millions more based on whether Canoo hits or exceeds a target of hiring military veterans to make up 10 percent of the workforce at the facility [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar).

Partnering with VDL Nedcar as a contract manufacturing partner to manufacture the Lifestyle Vehicle for the US & EU markets while it builds its US-based mega micro-factory. By parallel pathing contract and owned manufacturing Canoo will meet its commitment to start production and deliver vehicles in Q4, 2022. Canoo Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that VDL Nedcar ‚Äòis the top trusted European manufacturer building high quality products for leading OEMs, and they significantly outcompeted the other contenders. VDL is also independently owned by the van der Leegte family of entrepreneurs - which aligns with our commitment to support businesses that form the backbone of communities. This strategic partnership will enable us to deliver vehicles to market while we build our Phase 2 factory in Oklahoma. It also strongly positions us for geographic expansion in Europe and builds a lasting relationship with VDL Groep of companies. Our investment will help us scale quickly and fulfill our mission to bring affordable, purpose-built EVs to Everyone.‚Äù The Nedcar facility is slated to build up to 1000 units for both the US and European markets in 2022 with a target of 15,000 units in 2023 [link]( https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner)

De-risking the path to market, Canoo designed, built and tested beta for its lifestyle vehicle [link](https://gyazo.com/e9e9bee044f83da1536c1ab57809dece), with highlights including:

Partnering with the frontdoor collective for 10,000 MPDVs, the frontdoor collective are a network of delivery service partners that provide dependable last-mile delivery experience, with founders and executives with experience from FedEx, Walmart, XPO, Amazon, Instacart and the U.S. military. With more than 100 franchisees with experience in delivering for companies like Amazon, XPO, Axlehire and Ontrac, the company, aims to expand that to 300 franchisees by the end of this year [link](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-frontdoor-collective-executives-explain-importance-of-franchised-dsp-network). 

Surpassing 9,500 non-binding pre-orders across lifestyle vehicle, pickup track and multi-purpose delivery vehicle [link](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/second-quarter-2021-results) 

Showcasing its vehicles at various events including the ACT Expo and Cars & Coffee (both of which were attended by some of the amazing folks at the canoo subreddit who attended, took detailed notes/pictures and shared it with everyone), and receiving invites to others such as the LA Auto show [link](https://gyazo.com/ff9b83052183c0128970b65c4e05aa55).

**Part 5 ‚Äì Financials and Valuation**

Before looking at Canoo/Competitors, here are some analyst PTs

* R.F. Lafferty - $19 [link](https://www.investing.com/news/rf-lafferty-stick-to-their-buy-rating-for-canoo-2568124) 

* H.C. Wainright - $15 [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-goev-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-09/) 

* Bank of America - $5 (can‚Äôt find the article at the moment but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve seen it somewhere)

Average = $13, current SP = $6.7

As of Canoo‚Äôs second quarter 10Q, the company had cash on hand of $563.6 million [link](https://investors.canoo.com/financial-information/balance-sheet), which according to the company is more than sufficient to cover the cost of bringing its first products to markets [link](https://youtu.be/RzjX9GRDu6A?t=9398). 

The company could raise $273M from warrants if the SP is greater than $18 for 20 out of 30 days.

At a pre-revenue stage there‚Äôs not too much to say in this department, other than to note that value of a couple of orders:

* Over 9,500 non-binding preorders ‚Äì which if they are followed through with would be worth at least $313,500,00 (assuming 9,500 orders of the cheapest vehicle which is the base model MPDV).

* 10,000 MPDVs for the frontdoor collective which would be worth at least $330,000,000 (assuming cheapest MPDV).

As far as valuations go, let‚Äôs divide the pre-revenue EV manufacturers into tiers for an easier look ‚Äì based on their market cap. I‚Äôm sure some are missing because I only took a few, let me know and I‚Äôll add them in later. These market caps were taken within a few moments of each other on 9/21 from yahoo finance.

* Lucid Motors ‚Äì $41.23B, 11,000 pre-orders, delivery delayed to fall 2021

* Nikola Corporation - $4.25B, lowered delivery guidance of 25/50 vehicles for 2021 

* Fisker Inc - $3.917B, >17,000 pre-orders, value of $637,483,000 

* Faraday Future - $3.66B, 300 FF 91 Vehicles, value of $54,000,000 delivery in 2022 

* Canoo ‚Äì $1.63B, 19,500 pre-orders (9,500 individual + 10,000 front door collective), value of $643,500,000, delivery fall 2022 for LV, 2023 for MPDV 

* Company A (market cap too low, has a DOJ investigation ongoing and issued a going concern for whether it would have cash to make it to production) - $1.2B

Just looking at a couple of examples here it would seem that Canoo is undervalued purely on a pre-orders/revenue perspective. Fisker and Faraday Future, which are both expected to deliver in 2022 as is the case with Canoo, have over double the market cap despite Canoo having similar preorder value (compared to Fisker) or much higher (compared to Faraday Future). Haven‚Äôt done a cash flow analysis of every company but even taking into consideration Fisker having $400M more in cash on hand [source](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-242552/), there‚Äôs a significant discrepancy. Faraday Future meanwhile has less than half of Canoo‚Äôs cash on hand at $230M [link](https://sec.repor",,,,,,,

Mercedes-Benz,E 350, idk I think it ticks off the memeability criteria,,,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,E Class,,,,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,EQC, it seems that institutions have been loading up on Canoo for cheap, with institutional inflows of $177M and only $2.56M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GOEV/institutional-ownership/),,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,GL Class,,,,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,GLA 200, like at all, but if you‚Äôre one of the folks who look to just buy options for the sake of contributing to a gamma squeeze, take a look at the post by /u/ChemaKyle on how buying far OTM options and how it‚Äôs not the best idea if you want the MMs to hedge. There‚Äôs not much of a need to hedge vs something that doesn‚Äôt have a ramp up and no OI at the ATM values. I‚Äôd agree with his/her post and the commentators that buying ATM options and the underlying shares would have a greater chance at causing a gamma squeeze, but this is something you should research and do your own DD on as well based on your risk tolerance and investment threshold.,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,GLA Class,,,,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,GLB,,,,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,GLC Class,,,,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,GLE Class, with total EV sales growing from 2.5 million in 2020 to 11.2 million in 2025, then reaching 31.1 million by 2030. EVs would secure approximately 32 per cent of the total market share for new car sales.  The US electric vehicles market is now expected to reach 6.9 million unit sales by 2025, up 5x from 1.4 million unit sales forecast for 2020, due to government incentives driving EV ownership. ,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,GLS,,,,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,M Class,500 in the proposed $3.5 trillion budget blueprint Democrats passed a couple of weeks ago. In August, the Senate in a non-binding amendment narrowly voted in favor of prohibiting taxpayers from claiming EV tax credits if they make more than $100,000 annually or if vehicles cost more than $40,000. Either way, this is huge for Canoo which is offering base models of the Lifestyle Vehicle and MPDV at <$35,0, with the base pickup model expected to be priced similarly. ,
Mercedes-Benz,ML 270,,,,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,ML Class, with $115B+ accounting for 90% of 2020 profit pool in US, and ~60% of the transportation emissions (Canoo is targeting these segments with its Lifestyle Vehicle and Pickup) and targeting one of the fastest growing segments of delivery vans, for which ~2M more delivery vehicles will be needed globally by 2030, with its MPDV.,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,R Class,,,,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,S 320, which enables class-leading passenger and cargo volume on a small vehicle footprint. Canoo‚Äôs Chairman Tony Aquila mentioned that the company was focused on a product lineup that fits in the gaps of everybody else‚Äôs lineup‚Ä¶ take the turning radius of a Prius, the size of a Ford Ranger, Payload of F-150 and sell it as one vehicle. The use, and subsequent re-use of the skateboard platform enables significant cost savings and risk reductions, with the platform providing a strong business advantage as it is consistent across Canoo‚Äôs vehicle lineup. If a project is started for a new vehicle which will have the skateboard platform as its foundation, they will be able to carryover engineer and labor, ~half, from one project to the next.
Mercedes-Benz,S 350,,,,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,S 500,,,,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,S Class,,,,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,SL 320,,,,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,SL 350,,,,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,SL Class,,,,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,SLC,,,,,,,,
Mercedes-Benz,SLK 200,500, and if we add in state incentives e.g. Illinois with it‚Äôs $4,000 rebate ‚Äì that turns into $16,500. The LV is priced at $34,750 which means that post-rebates you‚Äôre getting it at almost half the price, pretty ridiculous in comparison to ICE vehicles, add in tighter emissions standards for ICE vehicles and Canoo starts looking pretty good.,

Mini,Cooper D,"Mercedes Benz C 63s | What do you guys think of this vehicle??

Worth the $$$? Plug-in hybrid.  I can't believe of the amount of HP and Torque this beast has!!  | I think Matt Farah described it as sounding like a hot hatch in a C class AMG body. Which is not a compliment. 

A 63 should be a V8. This is sacrilege.",,,,,,,
Mini,Cooper S,"What‚Äôs with the C class hate? | I have seen a lot of people in Reddit (not that much in this sub) express very negative views about the C class.

Basically ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a real Mercedes‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a premium car at all‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs dragging the brand downmarket‚Äù , etc. 

I wonder where this is all coming from? The baby Benz has been around since 1982. The naming convention changed to C class in 1992, but that happened with the E and S class lines as well. 

If anything the C class has been one of the brand‚Äôs core offerings for many, many decades. The 190E/C class have always fulfilled a very specific role for Mercedes, it‚Äôs basically a miniature version of the S class, inside and out, and I think that‚Äôs pretty cool.

I do think it‚Äôs really awesome how my own C class shares the same switchgear (door and window switches, electric seat controls, door handles, etc) and air conditioning vents, and other interior parts with Benz‚Äô flagship, and it‚Äôs been that way since at least 1993, and it‚Äôs the same in my 2020 C class. Even now the current generation shares the same ugly and cheap iPad center console and steering wheel haptic surface üòÜ 

The 3 series is probably the most iconic BMW, or at least it played a huge part on putting BMW in the map, and BMW knows it.  The Audi A4 has always been seen as a real Audi too.

I don‚Äôt get this new attitude towards the C class, I certainly don‚Äôt remember anyone in the  90s hating on the C class, though there was a little bit of it for the 190E, but it ended beating said criticism. 

Where do you feel it‚Äôs coming from? | C-Class used to stand for Cheap Class, according to the snobs. But if you get an E-Class, then the S-Class owners think you‚Äôre poor. And if you have an S-Class, then the Maybach owners think you‚Äôre poor. 

Then Mercedes came out with the A-Class and the CLA. Now that‚Äôs the newest not a real Mercedes.",,,,,,,
Mini,Countryman,"I discovered this little number last night as I rolled through my neighborhood Mercedes-Benz dealership‚Ä¶ Imagine paying $100,000 more than just a ‚Äúregular lol‚Äù S Class. You could almost pick yourself up the roadster in the last picture ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è | They're two different types of cars. Maybachs are meant to be limousines.",,,,,,,

Mini,Hatch,"Tryna buy a 2nd car (CL 500) at 18yo. Bad idea?  | (I am copy and pasting this from my r/whatcarshouldibuy post) Hi guys, I am a 17yo (18 in 1 month from today).
Currently I am paying off my 2017 Ford Focus
ST-3 ($275 a month), I make about $400 a week as of right now. I am looking to buy a 2001-2006 CL 500 (and keep the focus, no changing my mind.) My ""standards"" are less than 100k miles, under $10k, NO ACCIDENTS, and going for 3 or less owners. I'm strict on all of them except for the # of owners. Insurance was quoted at $315 a month for full coverage on a 2005 CLK500
Convertible. My question is, do yall think this is going to be a stupid purchase? Everything l've read online tells me the M113 engine (5.0L V8 engine that is in the CL 500) is insanely reliable. If I buy this car, It would be a fun, non-daily driver.
Using it for stuff like going downtown in the city with my friends, etc etc, you get the point. I just wanna have a loud V8 rwd car that I can enjoy. I strongly believe in myself that I can pay the whole thing off and afford insurance as well as paying off the focus. Do you guys think this is going to be a terrible purchase at my age? Are these things really as reliable as they are said to be? (Yes I'm aware of the ABC suspension issues, only looking for a car with no problems in that category). Sorry for the yap, Imk what yall think. | It‚Äôs the epitome of dumb. You‚Äôre a 17 y.o. with a car, you‚Äôre already in a minority of lucky / blessed / hard working teenagers to have a car at all.

Add to this that an 8 cyl rear wheel drive ‚Äúfun time out w friends‚Äù car will 90% end in a car accident in the hands of a teenager (don‚Äôt get mad - it‚Äôs statistically true that you‚Äôre still an idiot).

Mitsubishi,Eclipse Cross,"Ex-New Yorker US-Spec 1999 Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class, now in Luxembourg-City, Luxembourg. Discreet at the front. | The NFL logo sticker on the back is particularly odd. I wonder if they were from a previous owner before this car made its way to Europe? Or if the current owner works for the NFL or a European firm involved in NFL promotions in Europe?",,,,,,,
Mitsubishi,Grandis,"Alfa Romeo Giulia or Mercedes-Benz CLA 250 | So I‚Äôm looking into getting a used car, and 2 cars have sparked my interest. One is a 2019 Alfa Romeo Giulia TI Sport, plentiful with options and a red interior, and the other is a 2020 Mercedes-Benz CLA-250, though I am not entirely sure about the packages, due to them not being listed, so I would have to call and find out. That being said, it appears to be plentiful in options as well. The Alfa Romeo has around 11k miles for $32k and is a RWD, and the Mercedes has 19k miles for $30k. Now I‚Äôm not entirely sure about the Benz, but I know that I could definitely get cheaper for the Alfa, so hopefully the price is negotiable. 

Which of these cars would you guys prefer, and why? The reason I like the Alfa Romeo is because how sporty and different it looks from everything on the road. It has an aggressive approach, and genuinely looks like a sports car, rather than a ‚Äúsporty‚Äù car. It‚Äôs a good contrast between both luxury and sport, especially with that beautiful red interior, but that being said, the Mercedes interior is overall just better for the price. You get way more features, primarily technology wise, beautiful ambient lighting which is something that I LOVE, as well as various other things that make the interior stand out from pretty much every other interior on the road. I also like the look of the CLA 250. It looks nice and ‚Äúsporty‚Äù, but also has a signature Mercedes luxury look to it. It also reminds me a lot of the CLS, which is a nicer, more expensive Benz. The main thing about the Alfa Romeo for me is the rarity of it, the beauty of it, that amazing looking looking red leather, and that, from what I‚Äôve heard, it‚Äôs driving actually resembles that of a sports car, that it‚Äôs fun to drive, handles like a beast, as well as other fun factors. It‚Äôs also faster than the CLA, so for the sport and fun factor, the Alfa Romeo takes the cake. Now for the CLA, it has so much technology in the interior, beautiful ambient lighting, a great luxury experience, great exterior styling, that, like the Giulia, stands out from the other vehicles on the road. The interior would take you to another place of your own, outside of anything happening around you. As far as sport, it‚Äôs lacking compared to the Alfa, but what you get in the interior is beyond that of Alfa.

There‚Äôs also the question of reliability. Which brand will be more reliable? Which has a higher cost of maintenance? Which typically has more problems? 

Please help me come to a decision, I am torn between these two beautiful cars! | The Alfa is indeed very sexy but my concern would Alfa's dealer network versus Mercedes. It would probably be much easier to find a dealer to have the Mercedes serviced, unless you just so happen to live right near an Alfa dealership. 

This is also just speculation but I suspect the Alfa would most likely be less reliable. Alfa Romeo is part of FCA who's brands usually scores pretty poorly on dependability rankings. In that regard the Mercedes is probably the more sensible choice. That said, I don't think you buy an Alfa Romeo for dependability rankings or sensibility. You buy it for the emotions it gives you. If you really feel it in your heart I say go for it.",,,,,,,

[ Good morning r\/Superstonk, neighborhood jellyfish here!  ](https://i.redd.it/ehs02c6dwd971.gif)

I would like to revisit some more data recently released and posted and continue trying to tie this all together as the situation continues to evolve.

Posts being referenced: [1st Inflation Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nxxwqt/tldr_i_believe_inflation_is_the_match_that_has/), [Existing Home Sales May](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o6ie6p/a_deep_dive_into_the_housing_data_released/), [New Home sales May](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o6soxw/part_ii_a_deep_dive_into_the_housing_data/), [Fed Balance Sheet through 6/16](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o2dw45/thoughts_on_the_feds_balance_sheet_after_todays/), [It‚Äôs not just manufacturing supply shortages, manufacturers can‚Äôt get people for work](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/od9tt1/a_deep_dive_into_some_more_of_the_data_released/), [6.4% annualized inflation (PCE, excluding food and energy the most conservative inflation measure US government releases and the Fed relies on)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o7r4zw/the_feds_favorite_inflation_measure_which_is_the/)

I want to start by revisiting the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet. The last time we talked about it (6/17), it stood at a then RECORD $8.064 trillion. Let‚Äôs write this one out: $8,064,000,000,000.As of July 1st, that number stands at a **NEW RECORD $8,078,544,000,000**‚Äîan increase of $14,544,000,000.

[ $8,078,544,000,000](https://preview.redd.it/z8dnwn5swd971.png?width=1827&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c72023ffe5b27cd93dfceb0df11fbf263ec6d5b)

[Look at that triangle that has started at $7 trillion! ](https://preview.redd.it/jwxf3k0uwd971.png?width=1465&format=png&auto=webp&s=ceb3523e78313f82c4376e1fb65ec775e1b9cc16)

# 

# So what caused the jump in the balance sheet?

The Treasury General Account (TGA), which Yellen said in February she wanted to [get to $500 billion by the end of June](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0011), actually increased by $86.815 Billion to $851 Billion.

Federal Reserve Notes, net jumped $4,594 million.

# The Fed‚Äôs balance sheet is jumping while we are watching the housing bubble inflate in front of us.

The rate of sales continues to trend downward, but median home prices for **existing homes** are up 23.6% year-over-year to an all-time high of $350,300 with May rising at the greatest year-over-year pace since at least 1999, up from $283,500 last year and $340,600 in April.

So, months‚Äô supply is increasing (supply taking longer to move), sales are beginning to decrease (.9%) (demand), and median existing-home price across all housing types hit a record high of $350,300 in May, an increase of 23.6% from the year before (price).

Despite supply increasing for months, **single-family home sales** by homebuilders to the public in May fell 6% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 769,000 houses, down 23% from the recent high in January. This steep decline in sales occurred amid rising prices.

The median price of new single-family houses rose 2.5% from the previous month, and spiked 18.1% year-over-year, to a record $374,400:

https://preview.redd.it/4xj0opyl1e971.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=6690f087ada69f13a8c35b8841a34c4d48e036c1

The drop in sales of new homes in the past months brought sales back to about pre-pandemic levels. On the other end of our equation, inventory really is rising!

Unsold speculative houses rose for the fifth month in a row to 330,000 houses and months‚Äô supply rose to 5.1 months.

New single-family homes completed since Jan 2021 : 1,328,000+1,347,000+1,497,000+1,426,000+1,368,000 = 6,966,000 homes

New single-family homes sold since Jan 2021 : 993,000 +823,000+886,000+817,000+ 769,000 = 4,288,000 homes

Supply is up +2,678,000 homes in 2021 so far.

Stated another way:

The current supply is steadying with current inventory not moving at the current prices and is increasing as more homes come online (census bureau has it at \~ 4-8 months in 2020 to build from start to finish, projects started during the pandemic will be coming online), Demand is decreasing, Median Prices has increased to an all-time high.

&#x200B;

**With the conditions of the housing market above, I believe we are entering ‚Äòtextbook‚Äô bubble territory.**

[ Source: https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/h\/housing\_bubble.asp ](https://preview.redd.it/bcoa3frsxd971.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d348043be4dd619112aad871705fd00ba02f737)

Ok, as we covered above, demand had been through the roof, but the supply is back on the rise and current stock is taking longer to move. At the same time, demand for new mortgages is decreasing as the supply continues to hold and increase‚Äîbut prices continue to go up!

https://preview.redd.it/e8ge1yn0yd971.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=adbea8646a332e991679cf2214603ff39a2b499e

But what about delinquency rates? This can be a source to the supply...

[ https:\/\/www.mba.org\/2021-press-releases\/may\/mortgage-delinquencies-decrease-in-the-first-quarter-of-2021 ](https://preview.redd.it/e2jq2nc3yd971.png?width=1111&format=png&auto=webp&s=20b980c2faf5d470a30dc34a8f3106acdfc79fc3)

&#x200B;

>On a year-over-year basis, total mortgage delinquencies increased for all loans outstanding. The delinquency rate increased by 141 basis points for conventional loans, increased 498 basis points for FHA loans, and increased 297 basis points for VA loans.The delinquency rate includes loans that are at least one payment past due but does not include loans in the process of foreclosure. The percentage of loans on which foreclosure actions were started in the first quarter rose by 1 basis point to 0.04 percent. The percentage of loans in the foreclosure process at the end of the first quarter was 0.54 percent, down 2 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020 and 19 basis points from one year ago. This is the lowest foreclosure inventory rate since the first quarter of 1982.The seriously delinquent rate, the percentage of loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the process of foreclosure, was 4.70 percent. It decreased by 33 basis points from last quarter and increased by 303 basis points from last year. From the previous quarter, the seriously delinquent rate decreased 34 basis points for conventional loans, decreased 19 basis points for FHA loans, and decreased 37 basis points for VA loans. Compared to a year ago, the seriously delinquent rate increased by 205 basis points for conventional loans, increased 771 basis points for FHA loans, and increased 379 basis points for VA loans.

**Then there are those still in or coming out of forbearance with the likely expiration and non-renewal of these Covid rules at the end of the month:**

[The Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) latest Forbearance and Call Volume Survey revealed that the total number of loans now in forbearance decreased by 2 basis points from 4.18% of servicers' portfolio volume in the prior week to 4.16% as of May 30, 2021. According to MBA's estimate, 2.1 million homeowners are in forbearance plans.](https://www.mba.org/2021-press-releases/june/share-of-mortgage-loans-in-forbearance-slightly-decreases-to-416-percent)

https://preview.redd.it/1hp4jrdbyd971.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&s=33d5b84e2ff464c95a84049f5887674a1bc3f224

&#x200B;

While it is great to see people come out of forbearance, if I am reading the numbers correctly, more than half of folks coming out are still going to have amounts that still need to be paid back. Budgets are already stretched tight, wage growth is decreasing, and inflation is making everything else more expensive.

So, the central-bank asset purchases that continue chugging along [($120 billion per month](https://www.wsj.com/articles/central-bank-will-begin-reducing-bond-purchases-well-before-raising-interest-rates-powell-says-11618421656)) continue to help directly inflate this bubble! The music on inflating home prices is going to stop!

This brings me back to a comment from earlier this week I made in the RRP‚Äôs post:

>Inflation is blowing up as they have a full-blown liquidity crisis on their hands!  
>  
>The Fed has backed themselves & the banks in a corner after letting the printer run brrrrr.

However, if JPow keeps letting the printer run, he risks hyperinflation and [further cracks in support from his members](https://web.archive.org/web/20210630081637/https:/www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/business/economy/inflation-federal-reserve.html).

**This is the game of chicken the Fed is caught up in‚Äîdemand for housing (as we covered above) is going down, supply is increasing, yet prices continue to inflate‚ÄîI believe this is in large part because of the $120 billion per month central bank MBS is allowing prices to continue to increase and build this bubble!**

Let‚Äôs revisit the rate of inflation from my first post. The [CPI report](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nwodvj/the_consumer_price_index_climbed_06_from_the/) had inflation at 5% and we reviewed  ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index Effective Yield @ 4.47% -.53% adjusted for inflation (Highly Speculative) and ICE BofA CCC & Lower US High Yield Index Effective Yield @ 6.83% 1.83% adjusted for inflation (‚Äúextremely speculative‚Äù to ‚Äúdefault is imminent with little prospect for recovery‚Äù).

Annualizing the Personal Consumption Expenditures, excluding food and energy (PCE), again the *most conservative* inflation number the government offers, from the BEA report the other day, inflation is at 6.4%--inflation is at least 28% higher than the first time we examined this at 5%!!!

Looking at the bonds again, adjusted for inflation, things are worse!

[ ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index Effective Yield @ 4.44&#37; -1.93&#37; adjusted for PCE inflation \(Highly Speculative\) ](https://preview.redd.it/2zrpzjetyd971.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=9afed52a1cd40a63a9fb923cf8953c2559a15d48)

[ ICE BofA CCC & Lower US High Yield Index Effective Yield @ 6.60&#37; .2&#37; adjusted for inflation \(‚Äúextremely speculative‚Äù to ‚Äúdefault is imminent with little prospect for recovery‚Äù\) ](https://preview.redd.it/m0nc740uyd971.png?width=1463&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ef8591e2dc1146b2e6d241184a0178f6299e362)

Can we let that sink in again for a moment? To get any sort of positive yield an investor must expose themselves to bonds rated **‚Äúextremely speculative‚Äù to ‚Äúdefault is imminent with little prospect for recovery‚Äù.** If they invest in the Single-B ‚Äò**Highly Speculative‚Äô** they lose principal capital to inflation!

Remember, they can‚Äôt just sit on this cash as the dollar is losing buying power (as we have covered before), the cash would get eaten by inflation, and it is a liability for them‚Äîsince they must pay interest on client cash. (This is where having *too much* cash is considered a liquidity crisis! There isn‚Äôt enough good debt to place it in!). No wonder the Reverse Repo Markets are so heavily used!

Before we go any further, let‚Äôs do some quick level setting on bonds and their risk descriptions:

[ How the Credit Rating Agencies Classify Corporate Bonds and Loans by¬†Credit Risk or the Risk of Default.](https://preview.redd.it/5pbdgumczd971.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=032247d092bcbcc01e6b348857e2c16839955c33)

[Any excuse to use this clip again makes my day... ](https://reddit.com/link/oe6i3l/video/gt4rvt8gzd971/player)

Again, JPow believes this inflation is transitory and will drop back down to 2%. The Fed has been 2 steps behind on inflation and I think they are severely underplaying a new wild dynamic in this inflation madness‚Äîpeople and businesses are willing to pay these [increased prices](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o59uyb/no_inflation_my_waffle_house_has_had_to_print_new/)!

We have looked extensively at the record median prices in homes, but let‚Äôs consider cars for a minute. This is why I think the inflation game has changed! According to data from the [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?1921=underlying&isuri=1&reqid=19&step=2#1921=underlying&isuri=1&reqid=19&step=2) June sales for autos fell to 1.30 million vehicles, down 14.2% from June 2019, after a strong March, April, and May.

Vehicle sales picture

The Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate (SAAR) of sales,(takes the number of selling days and other seasonal factors into account and then annualizes the result), vehicle sales look:

June: 15.4 million SAAR, -9.5% from June 2019; the lowest for any month since January 2014.

May: 17.0 million SAAR, -1.0% from May 2019.

April: 18.6 million SAAR, the highest total for any month in 16 years, +7.4% from April 2019.

March: 17.9 million SAAR, +7.9% from March 2019.

Carmakers and dealers are making money hand over fist though! Dealers by and large don‚Äôt produce ‚Äòeconomy‚Äô cars and trucks anymore. Everything is has shifted to high profit-margin vehicles‚Äîfor example, Ford (except for the Mustang) doesn‚Äôt produce cars anymore!

Because of this and shifting to have ‚Äòon-demand' inventories, the average transaction price for cars is at record highs, so is average gross profits per unit‚Äîthe average transaction price (ATP) of new vehicles in June jumped 14.9% from a year ago, to $40,206, a [joint forecast from J.D. Power and LMC Automotive](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210625005063/en/J.D.-Power-and-LMC-Automotive-U.S.-Automotive-Forecast-for-June-2021)‚Äîa record surge,

The trade-in market is also nuts! [The chip shortage](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2021/07/02/ford-sales-fall-27-june-lingering-chip-shortage/7839245002/) and covid have set the secondary market on fire. Normally, it is tempered through rental car companies and the like offloading their fleets. Covid has thrown a huge wrench into that, and add in the chip shortage in new vehicles, has led to what I believe is **the fairy dust on this inflation fire**, reports of low-mileage used vehicles costing more than the new model would cost if it were available.

**(timeout, I do hope RC and the GameStop team are reading up on how Toyota is killing this chip shortage since they had this sort of risk already identified in their Business Continuity Plan because of what happened with Fukushima in 2011!)**

A study by [iSeeCars](https://www.iseecars.com/used-cars-cost-more-than-new-study), which combed through over 470,000 new vehicles and ‚Äúlightly used‚Äù 2019 and 2020 model-year vehicles, found that the gap between new and slightly used had ‚Äúdrastically narrowed‚Äù across the board, and it found that 16 hot models were selling for more money as used vehicles than their equivalent new versions, that were not in stock.

On top of this list is the Kia Telluride, it would sell for $44,166 as new vehicle sold for $47,730 as a slightly used vehicle. The first six on the list were either pickups (GMC Sierra 1500, Toyota Tacoma, Toyota Tundra) or SUVs (Telluride, Mercedes-Benz G-Class, Toyota RAV4 Hybrid).

**Rather than haggle till they get the price down, or just not buy as they had done for a couple of years of the Great Recession, consumers are buying are paying whatever it takes to get a new or used vehicle or new or used home as their whole mindset about inflation has changed!**

[The brakes on inflation have been cut! This beast is going to keep running! ](https://preview.redd.it/75z9o0bf0e971.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=be0146e852127aa6467848a5b4a3d31189834415)

OK, so to try and wrap this up again:

¬∑ More cash is going to continue to pour in that needs to be placed.

¬∑ Inflation is going to make it impossible to earn positive rates on assets after being adjusted for inflation on anything but ‚Äúextremely speculative‚Äù to ‚Äúdefault is imminent with little prospect for recovery‚Äù risks.

¬∑ Cash can be stashed with the Fed @ 0.05% currently

¬∑ Previous collateral (zombie CMBS as an example) is considered junk and may be losing value due to being mistakenly rated/valued to begin, with yield rates, which had been used to secure the balance sheet now also being eaten by inflation. ([Washington Prime Group and certain of its subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since the last time](https://investor.washingtonprime.com/investor-relations/news-and-views/news/news-details/2021/Washington-Prime-Group-Commences-Voluntary-Chapter-11-Financial-Restructuring-with-RSA-Supported-by-Over-70-of-Holders-of-Secured-and-Unsecured-Corporate-Debt/default.aspx))

¬∑ Their cash can‚Äôt be used as collateral because it is a liability, and even if used, will suffer a loss of value from inflation.

Opinion: Because of inflation, the shorts are going to drown in their cash. There is no place for it to go to earn a positive yield greater than what inflation will eat, or should be acceptable for the level of risk of default.

With nowhere to park this cash to generate positive yields and while having to contend with balance sheets that are having assets eaten away, participants will continue to use the Reverse Repo to buy time until:

Being down in real terms because of inflation is something that **cannot be made back up** to service the debt and will weigh on balance sheets as they try to protect from margin calls.

Their existing collateral on the balance sheet can get re-rated lower, re-appraised lower, or just eaten by inflation to the point even what they are borrowing in treasuries can‚Äôt meet the requirements to hold off a margin call.

They hit the 80 billion Reverse Repo limit because of nowhere else to place cash, are tapped out on treasuries, and no longer able to post acceptable collateral to meet their margin requirements.

# Finally, GameStop now faces inflation concerns because of that fat stack of cash they have ready to deploy!

I am sure RC and company have plans to deploy that capital in ways that will earn more than the rate of inflation, but I would like to propose they consider setting at least 1% of that cash aside to hedge the company against inflation moving forward to invest in b I t c o I n and e t h e r e u m.

I know this investment suggestion is probably controversial! However, I've been in crypto longer than GameStop (and DFV has been in GameStop), and it was understanding these fundamentals that helped make his explanations and some of the DD here click for me to ape into GameStop when I learned about it.

I am happy to touch on these subjects in the comments further (but I do want to keep this on the topic as much as possible and try and wrap up), but in short, I believe in [PlanB‚Äôs Stock-to-Flow](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD) hypothesis on b I t c o I n.

I think GameStop could benefit some cash to this asset that cannot be inflated away, and as Elon proved, can be turned from cash-b I t c o I n-cash instantly.

More importantly, though, I think the company should allocate a portion of that to staking e t h e r e u m and offering the ability to stake to GameStop‚Äôs user base.

In the future, I believe GME values decentralization of ownership of our digital assets, which is why we should buy and mint NFT‚Äôs on GameStop‚Äôs Blockchain.

For the less blockchain familiar GameStop users, I think GameStop should open up the protocol to allow ETH2 staking with GME? Empower the players to secure the metaverse?

For the balance sheet though, if you're staking on E t h e r e u m 2.0, E t h e r e u m 's parallel PoS network, your operations are earning you a roughly 8% annual percentage return (APR). T**his number is higher than the rate of inflation that we covered as well! Yes, E t h e r e u m fluctuates in price, but as we covered above, staking will also further secure and make the network stronger, which in turn does the same for the metaverse!**

EIP-1559 is in flight. What this means is that net ""issuance"" of new coins minted is going to be dramatically lowered. To put it in perspective, the issuance rate right now is 4.5% per year, the estimates for the issuance rate after EIP 1559 is implemented are .5 - 1%. Why does this matter?

So b I t c o in issuance halves every 4 years right? (this is what makes the stock-to-flow model tick) Well, an issuance drop from 4.5% is the equivalent of 3 halvenings happening at one time. (4.5 cut in half to 2.25 again to 1.125 and again to .56). E t h e r e u m is already at a multi-year low supply on exchanges, once this happens E t h e r e u m will become more instantly scarce. People have dubbed this the ""Cliffening"".

**I believe this increasingly scarce asset that will also secure the metaverse would be a great place to place cash to avoid inflation!**

EDIT 1: Many in the comments are viewing the crypto turn to fight inflation as me turning to shilling crypto. My response to that is:

[Again, I understand that RC and company are going to be deploying a lot of that war chest but how do we best protect the cash war chest in the interim?!?! ](https://preview.redd.it/53wm6muddf971.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=68e07ffe18433ea474db230136b470bf1c3fbb70)

TL:DR ‚Äì I believe inflation is the match that has been lit that will light the fuse of our rocket. | I am an appraisal analyst in the real estate industry and my anecdotal observations back up the DD above.  We are seeing more and more appraisals that either a) don't meet the sale price value, or b) do meet the value but the appraisals aren't worth the paper they were written on.  In other words, values are being stretched to the point of breaking, just as they were in 2007-2008 before the crisis hit.  

Another issue with housing is similar to what the OP said about cars: ""Dealers by and large don‚Äôt produce ‚Äòeconomy‚Äô cars and trucks anymore. Everything is has shifted to high profit-margin vehicles"".  Similarly no one builds ""affordable"" housing.  Why?  Higher profit margins on luxury homes.  Problem is, when real estate prices decline (as the inevitably do) luxury home sales decline faster than any other price bracket.  And because the real estate market is not particularly liquid, i.e., it will take months for new inventory at lower values to be created, we end up with a glut of high end homes that have to drastically reduce their prices in order to sell, which in turn pushes down values of all other homes in the market.

Some good news: while evictions are still a looming problem, foreclosures may not be.  FHA, Fannie, and Freddie all have policies in place that will allow those coming out of forbearance to restructure and move missed payments to the end of the term, often in conjunction with a lower interest rate.  This should at least help slow the decline of housing prices, and more importantly will keep all of those people in their homes.",,,,,,,

Nissan,Cabstar,"Bye America: A practical guide for patriotic Canadians | Hello r/canada

Long-time reader, first-time poster.

With Trump arbitrarily imposing tariffs on Canadian products and services, apparently as a starting point of a bigger economic war and possible annexation of Canada, now is the time for Canadians to stand together against his aggression. This post is meant to be practical, actionable ideas for all Canadians to resist Trump‚Äôs tariffs. Let's send the message to Trump: if you don't want to do business with Canada, you have no business here at all.

This is also a starting point. It‚Äôs unlikely that anyone will be able to do all of these things, all of the time, but the more people who do them, and the more of them we do, the bigger the impact will be. Many of the suggested Canadian alternatives are not present in every province. Please add your feedback and other ideas in the comments, and I will try to update the post.

Update: Thanks for all the comments! Have modified the list to correct and update it. A couple of useful websites flagged by other users.

* [madeinca.ca](http://madeinca.ca)
* [european-alternatives.eu](https://european-alternatives.eu)

# Don‚Äôt shop at American-owned stores.

Not all of the alternatives are Canadian-owned; they are simply not American. You can also just shop local, as many Canadians own non-chain businesses providing these goods and services

**Retail and consumer goods**

* Amazon ‚Üí depends what you‚Äôre buying, but there are always alternatives
* Walmart ‚Üí Loblaws, Metro, Canadian Tire, Co-op (in the west)
* Costco ‚Üí Federated Co-op, Bulk Barn (you might disagree with this; Costco is standing up to Trump, and sells many Canadian products in its stores)
* Home Depot -> Home Hardware, Rona
* Nike ‚Üí Lululemon, Roots, Nobis, Canada Goose, Aritzia
* Levi‚Äôs ‚Üí Naked & Famous

**Food and beverage**

* McDonald‚Äôs, Wendy‚Äôs, KFC, Five Guys ‚Üí Harvey's, A&W Canada, Burger‚Äôs Priest, Hero Certified Burgers, Mary Brown's (chicken)
* Starbucks ‚Üí Tim Hortons (though now Brazilian-owned), Second Cup, Bridgehead, Country Style, Coffee Time, Deville
* KFC, Popeyes ‚Üí your local ma and pa chicken place
* Subway ‚Üí Mr. Sub
* Krispy Kreme ‚Üí Beavertails
* Chipotle ‚Üí Freshii
* Taco Bell ‚Üí Mucho Burrito, Bar Burrito
* Domino‚Äôs, Little Caesar‚Äôs ‚Üí Pizza Pizza, Pizza Nova
* Dairy Queen ‚Üí Chapman‚Äôs Ice Cream, Laura Secord, Kawartha Dairy
* Denny‚Äôs, IHOP ‚Üí Sunset Grill, Humpty‚Äôs or Cora‚Äôs
* Applebee‚Äôs, Chili‚Äôs ‚Üí Montana‚Äôs, Kelsey‚Äôs
* Olive Garden ‚Üí East Side Mario‚Äôs
* Buffalo Wild Wings ‚Üí St. Louis Bar & Grill
* Outback Steakhouse, Texas Roadhouse, Ruth‚Äôs Chris ‚Üí The Keg, Chop, Hy‚Äôs
* P.F. Chang‚Äôs ‚Üí Manchu Wok or Congee Queen

# Don‚Äôt buy American goods.

This will be difficult, because so many of our day-to-day consumer products are owned by American companies. That said, the big Canadian grocery and drug store chains have their own-brand ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù versions of most of these American products, which are probably cheaper than the brand-name versions. When in doubt, check the label.

* Procter & Gamble (Tide, Gillette, Pampers, etc.) ‚Üí Attitude, Green Beaver
* Johnson & Johnson (Tylenol, Band-Aid, Aveeno, etc.) ‚Üí Life Brand (Shoppers Drug Mart), Jamieson Vitamins, Rexall
* Colgate-Palmolive (Colgate toothpaste, Irish Spring, Softsoap, etc.) ‚Üí Green Beaver
* Unilever (Dove, Hellmann‚Äôs, etc.) ‚Üí Canadian soap makers, President‚Äôs Choice Mayo
* Coca-Cola (includes Dasani, Powerade, etc.) ‚Üí PC Cola, Clearly Canadian
* PepsiCo (includes Lay‚Äôs, Gatorade, Quaker, Tropicana, etc.) ‚Üí Kiju, Nature‚Äôs Path
* Kraft Heinz (Kraft Dinner, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, etc.) ‚Üí Lactalis (Black Diamond, Cracker Barrel), PC Mac & Cheese
* Campbell‚Äôs Soup ‚Üí Habitant (by Loblaws), Baxters
* Hershey‚Äôs (Reese‚Äôs, Twizzlers, etc.) ‚Üí Nestl√© (Switzerland), Canadian chocolate makers (Purdy‚Äôs, Laura Secord)
* Mars (M&M‚Äôs, Snickers, etc.) ‚Üí Cadbury, Canadian brands like Ganong
* Mondelez (Oreo, Ritz, Triscuit, etc.) ‚Üí Dare, local bakeries
* General Mills (Cheerios, Nature Valley, etc.) ‚Üí Nature‚Äôs Path (Canadian), Love Grown

Worth noting (thanks commenter!) that [Well.ca](http://Well.ca) allows you filter for Canadian products

# Use Canadian transportation

* **Gas:** Esso, Chevron, and Shell ‚Üí  Petro-Canada, Husky, Irving
* **Rides:**  Uber and Lyft ‚Üí Use local taxi services (e.g., Beck Taxi, TappCar) or transit

# Don‚Äôt buy American services.

Hard to avoid some of these, but not impossible.

* Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Paramount+ ‚Üí Crave, CBC Gem, CBC Kids, BritBox, Mubi
* Hollywood (Warner Bros, Universal, etc.) ‚Üí try some Canadian cinema like TIFF films or the Banff Mountain Films
* Google Drive, Dropbox ‚Üí [Sync.com](http://Sync.com), Proton Drive (Swiss)
* Twitter/X (stay away, since it‚Äôs owned by Elon Musk) ‚Üí Bluesky, Mastodon
* Electronic Arts (video games) ‚Üí Ubisoft Montreal

# Don‚Äôt buy American cars, or at least buy a car made in Canada.

It‚Äôs obviously impossible to buy a car without any American parts. But, if you‚Äôre buying new, at least support Canadian auto workers.

Non-American cars made in Canada:

* Honda CR-V
* Toyota RAV4
* Lexus RX

Foreign car companies to consider ‚Äî but check if their cars are assembled in the US:

* Honda & Toyota ‚Äì Strong presence in Canada (CR-V, RAV4, and Lexus RX are built in Ontario).
* Mazda, Subaru, Nissan (includes Infiniti), Hyundai (includes Genesis), Kia ‚Äì Mostly Japanese or Korean, no American ownership.
* Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo ‚Äì European and not American-owned.

American cars assembled in Canada:

* Chrysler 300
* Dodge Charger, Dodge Challenger
* Ford Edge, Lincoln Nautilus
* Ram 1500
* Ford Superduty
* Chevrolet Silverado
* GMC Sierra

American car brands to avoid (no manufacturing presence in Canada), other than the models assembled in Canada that are listed above:

* Tesla - Obviously stay away from these, given Elon Musk‚Äôs role enabling Trump. Consider Polestar, Hyundai, Nissan, Volkswagen or Kia instead if looking to go electric
* Ford
* Chevrolet
* GMC
* Buick
* Cadillac
* Dodge
* Jeep
* Ram

# Don‚Äôt go to America, but be friendly and welcoming to Americans

* **Cancel any vacations in the United States.** There are plenty of things to see and do in Canada. Honestly, our dollar is likely to tank anyway, so American vacations are going to become more expensive
* **Sell American properties.** Get your money out while you still can. If it‚Äôs not Trump, then climate change will certainly destroy the value of properties in places that Canadians love to flock, including Florida, Palm Springs, and Arizona. (If extreme weather doesn‚Äôt destroy your property, the inability to get insurance certainly will reduce the property‚Äôs resale value!)
* **Invite American friends and acquaintances to visit Canada.** Tourism is one Canadian export that Trump cannot put tariffs on. Foreign visitors spend their money in our country.
* **Welcome visiting Americans with open arms.** Talk to them about how important Canada‚Äôs relationship with America is, and the importance of resisting Trump
* **Send Canadian goods to American friends and relatives as gifts**

# Travel elsewhere

# What else? | Hi everyone - we took a while to reflect on this one, and decided it was so well done and with a positive, active intent that it was worthwhile posting here.¬†

We remain committed to our sub's rules - please no full hatred and avoid generalizations. Ultimately we do need to come out the other side of this able to work with our neighbours, friends, and loved ones from the south, although there's no clarity on how long this will go on.

But Canadians have a strong history of kindness and togetherness, until someone takes advantage of that kindness. Then we plan, and act smartly and conclusively. This is that.

Edit: also a reminder that these are the products that Canada is creating tariffs for (the prior topic from r/canada)

Edit 3: there was a temporary agreement between our PM and the USA - a 30 day pause is in effect for any tariffs, the same as with Mexico-USA. Since this is technically not over and might happen again in March, we will keep this list as an announcement for some time still, since attitudes have already shifted as reality sets in. Stay kind out there, but we have now seen that everyone has limits.

Lexus is a bit more expensive, and the Mini is the newer release, but none of that should really matter in the decision making process

what am I missing? who in the world buys a mini cooper other than someone who thinks they look cute?

edit: didn't realize there was such a big following of mini! thank you all for the insight :) | They‚Äôre fun. They give you the sensations of going fast at legal speed.

She's starting a new job that involves driving 100 miles twice a week. We have an estate and a Citroen c1 with 100k miles on it.

She doesn't want to drive the estate as she likes small cars so I was toying with a Yaris, swift or mini hatch.

I'd be looking at around 2016 / 2017 - I believe their quality improved dramatically around this time - with around 40,000 miles on the clock.

Realistically do you think this is a mistake and she'll end up on the hard shoulder or more a case of having to pay extra for routine parts like shocks once a year or so? | Running costs won't be substantially higher than other small cars. In WhatCar's survey in 2022 for reliability, Mini came third behind Lexus and Toyota out of 32 brands tested.

The only arguments against a Mini are typically a higher purchase price (not as much of an issue if bought used) and their less than practical packaging (not generally an issue if you tend to make all your journeys solo).

If your Wife's dream car is a Mini, absolutely be supportive of that choice and go with them to get one. Better they get a car they're happy with than one that is better on paper, but ultimately makes them miserable.",,,,,,,

I have only heard bad things about the mirage, but this seems like a good deal, and it gets good gas milage.  | They aren't as bad as everyone says, if you live where it can snow ,I do recommend putting snow tires on it. I have driven Subaru outbacks and Kia rios and I can say the lighter vehicles are usually more fun. I doubt they are as boring to drive as everyone says ,especially with soft snow tires. The stock tires on them are a harder compound for fuel economy, just replace oil every 3k miles and transmission fluid every 20k miles no matter what they say.  It's actually appealing to me because it's lighter than a lot of supercars, so there's a lot of potential in the handing with proper tires and suspension setup. Also the 2017 Mitsubishi mirage stock 0-60 time is 10.9 seconds, the 1975 Camaro 3.8l i6 will also do 0-60 in 10.9 seconds. The 1970s AMC gremlins had a 0-60 time of about 20 seconds.

Peugeot,807,"Drove a Nissan Juke earlier, hats off! | ... to the owners for putting up with that shit.

TL:DR- Overall, the only enjoyable bit was the long stretches of motorway where cruise control drove for me and I didn't have to touch the pedals or gear stick (aka the entire process of actually driving the car). I think that tells you enough.

Drove the company car Juke about 400 miles, 6hrs total over the last two days. 73 reg with 29000 miles. The drive was about 75% motorway and a roads, the rest was b roads and urban. Some petrol engine, not sure which.

Even after what is essentially an extended test drive, I cannot understand why anyone would buy one for any reason other than cost. And even then, there are so many more options at this price point.

The good:
1. Buttons for AC control.
2. Keyless entry system was actually quite nice. It always locked and unlocked at the right time.
3. Satnav was actually quite nice to be honest. Overall a good experience.

The bad:
1. Gear stick - very vague and mushy. No satisfying click or any sound to let you know ""yeah you're in gear"". You just kind of pushed it into place and it was all spongy. If it didn't go any further then that was the only indicator.
2. Gearbox - probably doesn't effect normal Juke drivers but redline in second was barely 45 mph. The gearing up to 4th was so shit I found myself constantly shifting when in slower moving traffic or I'd have zero power.
3. Noise - holy shit was this car loud. My girlfriends 64 reg fiesta is less noisy. On a full set of Bridgestones, admittedly can't remember the exact tyre, but still! The whistling was awful too.
4. MPG - struggled to maintain 45mpg. Pretty abysmal when you consider how shit the acceleration is, and the majority motorway driving at 70 mph. No traffic queues.
5. Handling - felt like I was driving a block of cheese on springs. Wallowing around in corners and felt like I was going to tip over going more than 15 mph. Yes this is something you see on most crossovers, but still making the point here.
6. Dash - might be a me problem, but I like seeing my speed as a number (especially since I'm used to my Mazda's HUD) but there wasn't an option for it. Not a major issue, but you would think it would be there surely? 

I know everyone already hates the Juke but I feel like not everyone who says it has actually driven one, so thought I'd give a bit of insight. It does live up to the shittiness you gave heard. | Did you remember to have all the lights on, it‚Äôs compulsory",,,,,,,

I couldn‚Äôt view the catalogue of cars online so had to pop in and find out. They asked what car I was after, I said Nissan Leaf, e+Tekna, 62kWh; they immediately turned their nose up and tried to sway me towards hybrids.

They also mentioned that the Leaf was going out of production soon due to faults and misleading range claims. Avoid at all costs. They even said that they knew people who wanted to get rid of the vehicles because of the dire range and that the value in them is plummeting. I said they‚Äôre good value then and that‚Äôs why I want one. I don‚Äôt use it for commuting just school runs, shopping and occasional UK getaway - like Alton Towers and Wales.

Peugeot,RCZ,"Nissan NV400 engine reliability? | 

Good day!

I'm planning on buying a new van for my business. I've been looking at this manual Nissan NV400 (2017) with 2.3 liter diesel engine called M9T(?).

 It has 36k miles on it. I'm wondering how reliable the engine is? What should I expect? How about the transmission and overall the car..?

My friend said the engines get replaced quite often at 90k miles or so hence I'm trying to make my own research. 

There are quite a few of these vans on sale with same mileage which begs questions.

Peugeot,Rifter,"What's wrong with new Nissan Navara's | Thinking of getting a new Nissan Navara STX, and after test driving a bunch of utes, I really feel they are value for money considering the low interest rates and large discounts currently available. 

Fuel economy is competitive, I like how it drives. Certainly prefer it's on road handling over the current Hilux or Ranger. Less wobbly. Ranger had less road noise, but I think that was the tyres.

The engine is french, something I am not excited about, but it is an older design. So they had at least a decade to figure out any grimlins. 

Interior is much nicer, for less money get full leather and electric seats.. compared with fabric and manual adjustments in the others, comparable seats cost at least 10 grand more in the rivals. I don't care for electric seats (they are slow) but my wife loves them.

Some of the others have bigger screens, but that's a fairly superficial feature. I prefer buttons and dials over touchscreens anyway.

Looks good from the outside. My wife is the judge on appearance, and the Triton is too ugly, and the Hilux is too boring. Ranger is the best looking, with the Navara coming in second. Could not get a opinion on the Isuzu.

So, with my rumbling over. Considering the current pricing, why are Rangers, Triton's and Hilux's still way more popular?   

More capable at towing?  | I always like to point out that the Navara is the only one of the bunch that uses coil springs in the rear rather than leaf springs. Typically this results in better on-road comfort, even with stuff in the tray. I agree with you that it rides better than the competition. I really like the electric rear window in the Navara too. I think it's a nice touch that the others don't have.

As for why the Navara is less popular, I reckon that comes down to marketing. Do you remember the ""bugger"" ads from Toyota in the 2000s? The Hilux is a kiwi icon. It's also hard to drive anywhere without seeing a Ranger billboard, and the Ranger Raptor gives the marque a bit of ""cool"" factor. Anyway, people will argue until they're blue in the face about which one is ""better"". They're all much of a muchness. Pick the one that you like the most for your budget and lifestyle.",,,,,,,

Our horn stopped working and I am trying to find the fuse to check it as the first port of call. However I can‚Äôt find the fuse!

Is the horn fuse somewhere else or do these fuse have a hidden name?

Renault,Grand Modus,"Nissan Terrano II, OBD Problem | Question/Fault

Hello!

I have a 2003 Nissan Terrano II.

I bought an ELM327 OBD 2 scanner to find out why the check engine light is on. I can successfully pair the device to the phone as soon as I put the ignition on it. The ELM is connected, the application also displays this, but it cannot connect to the ECU. I have tried a lot of apps like OBD Mary, Torque and even the recommended Car Scanner app which is specifically for these devices. It can't connect to the ECU for some reason.

I tried it on a 2006 Suzuki Ignis, and it worked great.

I looked under the steering wheel for the fuse for the OBD II to see if it had blown, but there was no fuse that would operate the OBD-II.
There was no OBD-II or ECU-related fuse on the fuse box in the engine compartment either.


My question is, do you need any special scanner for this Nissan? This car is OBD-II capable so there should be no problem.
I am attaching a picture of the device.

Thanks for the answers, have a nice day | https://preview.redd.it/gciwjugsr71d1.jpeg?width=920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb6113aee386bafb2e7b1e2d63ba27d2bfb2714c",,,,,,,

Wenn m√∂glich, kauft einen in Silber, oder hellen T√∂nen. Der Lack ist sehr weich und verkratzt daher sehr schnell. 

Achtet auf Rost an Steinschl√§gen und an den T√ºrkanten.

Renault,Master Campervan,"Warum sind Opel Astra K so g√ºnstig? | Auf mobile sind die bei √§hnlichen km, Alter, Ausstattung preislich auf dem Niveau oder sogar unter Polo, Corsa, Ibiza, Fiesta.

Was ist der Haken? | Ich hab einen Astra K mit dem 1l Dreizylinder mit 105 PS. Ausstattung ziemlich spartanisch aber alles was man braucht: Tempomat, Klimaanlage, Apple Carplay und Android Auto. Sitzheizung w√§re dazu noch sch√∂n, aber sonst genau die Komfortfeatures die man braucht.

Kann ich absolut empfehlen, war auch bis jetzt (120k km, 3 Jahre ich gefahren, 3 Jahre davor mein Vater) komplett zuverl√§ssig. 

Den Motor w√ºrde ich auch empfehlen, au√üer man hat eine Familie und f√§hrt regelm√§√üig mit 4 Leuten und vollem Kofferraum, dann merkt man die 105 PS schon. Aber der kleine, leichte Motor passt erstaunlich gut in das Auto und die Drehmomentkurve l√§sst ihn viel st√§rker wirken als er tats√§chlich ist. 

Fahrverhalten und Wertigkeit finde ich absolut OK. Bin auch einen Golf 7 gefahren, ich finde, der Astra bietet mehr Fahrspa√ü (nat√ºrlich in einem gewissen Rahmen, ist noch immer ein Recht langsamer, g√ºnstiger hatchback). 

Generell sei auch gesagt, dass der Sprung von Astra J auf K massiv ist. Bin den J Mal gefahren und war schockiert wie viel schlechter der sich verglichen mit meinem K f√§hrt. Dann der Insignia B, der Lichtjahre √ºber dem A ist. Hab mich echt gefreut, was Opel/GM dann die Jahre drauf rausbringt und dann ist leider PSA eingestiegen. 

Teilweise k√∂nnte ich mir die g√ºnstigeren Preise daran erkl√§ren, dass die st√§rkeren Modelle das 6-Gang M32 Getriebe drin haben, die anf√§lliger f√ºr einen totalen Getriebeschaden waren. 

Der Hauptgrund ist sicher, dass Opel halt einfach nicht so beliebt ist. Der Insignia B ist auch brutal g√ºnstig gebraucht zu bekommen wenn man ihn mit einem Superb oder Passat vergleicht.",,,,,,,
Renault,Megane,"Auto aus der H√∂lle: Opel Combo C 1.6 CNG | Wie der ungl√ºckliche Zufall es so will, sind wir vor Jahren in den Besitz eines 2005 Opel COMBO CNG gekommen, der das schlechteste Auto war, hinter dessen Steuer ich mich jemals gesetzt habe.

Wie ist das Modell entstanden?
Ein paar Ingenieure von GM wollten einen kleinen Transporter herausbringen, ohne viel mentalen Aufwand hineinzustecken und haben eine Corsa vergr√∂√üert. Dann haben sie gedacht, dass Erdgas ja g√ºnstiger als Benzin ist und sie daraus ein Erdgasauto machen, mit dem gleichen lahmen 1.6er Sauger. 
Hier eine Zusamenfassung:


Performance:
Trotz 95 PS zieht die Karre schlechter als ein gr√∂√üerer und marginal schw√§cherer (90 PS) 1997er VW Sharan 1.9 TDI. Die Leistung wird typisch f√ºr Ottomotoren erst bei hoher Drehzahl erreicht und √ºber 100 km/h gehen Verbrauch und L√§rm exponentiell nach oben. 
Hier h√§tten 2 Liter Hubraum oder ein Turbo drin sein k√∂nnen. Als Handwerkerkarre in der Stadt w√§re ein Automatikgetriebe schon ganz nett. Die Performance mit Benzin (10l Tank) ist wesentlich schlechter, als mit Erdgas und manchmal kommt man kaum von der Stelle.

Ergonomie:
Die Sitze sind ergonomisch gestaltet, vorausgesetzt man ist mindestens 1,80 m gro√ü. Bei den unteren 30 cm ist mehr Platz, damit der dicke Hintern dahin passt. Mit 1,70 m hat die Karre extreme Ischiasschmerzen verursacht. Mit dickem Kissen l√§sst sich einigerma√üen schmerzfrei fahren.

Weiteres:
Die Innenraumlampe hat keinen Schalter und bei St√∂rungen empfehle ich, Panzertape nachts zur Abdunkelung aufzukleben.
Aus irgendeinem Grund ist die Ablage vorne geneigt und alles rutscht einem entgegen. Bewohnerparksusweise festkleben, da sie beim ersten Anfahren wegrutschen.

Gastank (siehe Foto):
Die Erdgastanks besitzen nicht nur eine Zulassung f√ºr 20 Jahre, sondern haben die Eigenschaft, durch Staubpartikel unter den Halterungen ihren Lack zu verlieren und dann zu rosten. Bei fortgeschrittenen Rost m√ºssen sie f√ºr ca. ‚Ç¨3000 ausgewechselt werden und das Auto kann entweder zum wirtschaftlichen Totalschaden werden oder wird weiter verkauft. Bei letzterem hat man sogar das Gl√ºck, dass sich die Tanks unter einer Abdeckung befinden und so potenzielle Kunden den Schaden erst gar nicht bemerke.

Gekauft 2005er Modell mit 160000 km.
M√§ngel nach Kauf:
-Leck am Gassystem
-Rostige Flaschen 
-K√ºhlerleck

Au√üerdem dazugekommen:
-Lenkung mit extremen Spiel, kleckert auf Kopfsteinpflaster

Renault,Modus,"Opel Corsa - Neu? | Stehe vor meinem ersten richtigen Autokauf und w√ºrde mich √ºber eine informierte Einsch√§tzung freuen. Ich suche einen praktischen Kleinwagen ohne viele KM (idealerweise <20 000) mit gutem Preis-Leistungs-Verh√§ltnis. Und die lokalen Autoh√§user haben eine gro√üe Auswahl an gebrauchten Opel Corsas, welche erstmal ganz gut zu passen schienen.

  
Habe dann jedoch heute hier von Problemen mit dem Zahnriemen gelesen, sowie dem Hinweis, dass die neuen Motoren wieder Kette haben werden. **Erste Frage**: Woher kriegt man diese Infos? Die Opel-Seite l√§sst diese Details leider vermissen.

  
Zweitens: Ich h√§tte die M√∂glichkeit einen neuen Corsa 'Edition' 1.2, 74 kW mit Wunschlakierung, Technik- und Comfort Paket f√ºr **17 200‚Ç¨** zu kaufen. Ist das ein gutes Angebot? Im Vergleich zu den gebrauchten die h√§ufig weniger Leistung und keine bessere Ausstattung haben im 13.5k‚Ç¨-16k‚Ç¨ Bereich erscheint mir das erstmal besser.

Renault,Scenic,"Crossland X - good or bad choice | I came across an opportunity to buy a 3 years old Crossland X 82 H with just right equipment for me. What do you think about this Opel model? Any insight? | My mom has owned one for the past 2 years. Here's some pros and cons of the car and the specific engine - the 1.3 petrol
Pros of the car:
-very comfortable to drive around the city and to travel on highways
-good audio system (for the cosmo trim) 
Cons of the car:
-mediocre noise proofing
-rear suspension bottoms out when driving fast over bumps and potholes
-the infotaiment system is slow, but steady, however it does not like android auto. At all
Pros of the engine:
-very good fuel economy
-reasonably quiet on low revs
Cons of the engine
-turbo lag. Not obvious, but noticable
And special con:
-the clutch is very weird. It grabs very hard and requires a lot of time to get used to

Overall opinion:
It's a nice car, but there are better options. You sit very high in the car so visibility in front of you is very good, but in the back is not so good. The back window isn't that tall, the wiper is tiny and the rear pillars are thick, whick makes the rear quarter windows very small. The manual transmission is only a five-speed (at least in Poland) and the shifter's throw is so large it makes changing gears feel like rowing a boat. The suspension is comfy, not to stiff, not to spongy, but the car has some body roll, so it tilts during high speed turns. 
I rate the Crossland X at 6.5/10
Personally I would choose something else, but if you like it, try it out first, then make your decisions.",,,,,,,

Men vi saknar fyrhjulsdrift (grusv√§g till huset vi fastnat p√• under vintern ett par ggr) samt motorv√§rmare f√∂r de kalla morgnarna. Android auto hade varit nice med. 

Tittar p√• (begagnad) v60 cross country och ett par andra bilar s√• som Opel Grandland X (hybrid), id4 GTX, Skoda Enyaq, √§ven provat en Subaru Outlander. 

V60CC awd dieseln toppkittad kostar 384kkr. Opel Grandland X hybrid kostar 270kkr med typ samma kit, ID4 gtx 440kkr, Subaru Outlander 380k. 

Sjuk besluts√•ngest.  Hade helst velat h√•lla mig n√§rmare 300k. Gillade Opel mycket... och framf√∂rallt hybrid (90% av v√•r k√∂rning √§r under 25km). Volvo k√§nns som ett tryggt men dyrt val. Speciellt f√∂r ""bara"" en diesel. Den har dock all utrustning man kan √∂nska. ID4 var en dr√∂m att k√∂ra och hade allt de andra hade. 

K√§nns som om man √§nd√• g√•r upp p√• de siffrorna volvon kostar kan man kika p√• en ID4 f√∂r 80k mer och slippa 3600 i skatt, minska verkstadskostnader samt n√§stan ha noll i br√§nslekostnad de n√§rmsta 5 √•ren (vi tankar f√∂r runt 16k/√•r idag).  

Dessutom lite tveksam till en ny diesel, vet ju inte vad som h√§nder med det rent skattem√§ssigt. 

Hur hade ni resonerat? Finns s√§kert fler bilar jag borde kolla p√•.

Edit. Kan till√§ggas att jag v√§rderar n tyst kup√© under f√§rd v√§ldigt h√∂gt. Volvo √§r riktigt bra d√§r, ID4 likas√•, och (f√∂rv√•nande f√∂r mig) √§ven Opel Grandland.  | ID 4 √§r nice, men t√§nk p√• att argumentet om att inte beh√∂va vara p√• verkstaden s√• mycket inte h√•ller. Visst har den ingen f√∂rbr√§nningsmotor s√• det m√∂get slipper du. Men du har fortfarande bromsar, st√∂td√§mpare etc som beh√∂ver service. Och s√• sjukt mycket k√§nslig elektronik som pajar och √§r dyrt. Typ SOS-moduler. D√§remot tror jag inte, om ni √§r vana vid en v90, kommer vara n√∂jda med utrymmet i ID4. Kolla p√• nya Passat hybriden eller ID7 ist√§llet.¬†

Och medan du har noll i br√§nslekostnad s√• √§r el verkligen inte gratis. I dagsl√§get √§r det n√§stan billigare att k√∂ra p√• bensin √§n el. M√§rker jag som k√∂r hybrid.¬†

Few weeks ago I made a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/sbk34v/buying_my_first_car/) asking for experience and advices about buying my first car in the Netherlands.

After some consideration, I decided to narrow my choices to Opel Karl and Toyota Aygo. They both have similar features, with Karl having bigger trunk capacity and Aygo having larger fuel tank.

Skoda,Kodiaq,"What are peoples view of the Peugeot 5008? | Looking for a 5+2, and was put off the Discovery Sport due to its appalling reliability. 

Reviews seem to suggest the Peugeot 5008 is reliable, economical and good to drive. 

Anyone have one and care to share your thoughts? | I have a 23 5008 GT, its a nice sized car and runs well enough on the roads and can fit the family of 5 here with plenty of space, it has its issues though with its user experience which I find and will explain below, but you may find these things don't annoy you, id recommend trialling it first and foremost if its a new one to see if you like it. 

I don't like the centre consoles ""piano keys"" setup on this 23 model and the way they have programmed the ""fondleslab"" to control stuff in the car is too distracting when driving when doing stuff like turning the fans on/off and altering the climate controls is too distracting, you put the air coming out of more than one direction at a time and it drops the blower strength significantly too. 

The UX is awful as if you only have one source in the car (radio) and nothing plugged in, pushing the music key requires you to again fiddle with the slab to select a source for music rather than natively flicking to the radio screen.  

Added which here its fondleslab screen blacks out and doesn't work randomly at times requiring a reset which means I have to lock the car leave it and walk away for about 10-15 minutes to get it to ""reset"" so I can use the screen in the car again.

The ""Start/Stop"" technology which you need to turn off each time if left on is not programmed right on the model, it cuts the engine when your still moving near a stop and also cuts out at junctions when you don't want it to resulting in some worries when your pulling off as it cuts and restarts the engine if your pulling off quick.",,,,,,,
Skoda,Octavia,"Peugeot 508 Opinions | Thinking of buying a 508, probably a 2019 model with 1.5hdi and manual box. Or similar. 
Alternatives would be an Audi A4 or A5 for 2016/2017 again diesel. Prefer to avoid BMW. 
Usage would be mainly commuting on motorway, upto 200miles per week.

What are they like to live with? Do PSA still run their own bespoke diagnostic software like the Lexia/PP2000?

Is the ride good in them? Would be concerned about the quality of them in comparison to the German marques.I've read elsewhere that they are over complicated and fiddly. 

I had looked at Citro√´n, but ruled them out quickly as none of their offerings interest me.

Thoughts?  | I had a G21 330i until last Nov as my dd. Made the move to a 508 SW GT 225. The main downsides for me vs the bmw are the lower power (you do notice it), the front wheel drive, and the non full screen Carplay. But the upsides definitely but the downsides imo: amazing mileage (PHEV and I can do my full commute on electric and charge at work). My average consumption is 0.3liter/100km over march (1307km so far). Bigger inside than the german equivalent (especially the boot).

Suzuki,Celerio,"Should I get a Peugeot RCZ? | So I am a first time car buyer and I went to the dealership and there was a really nice example of an RCZ (2013 with 86000km). It is a little bit above the budget (not by much though). So I have seriously been contemplating getting it.

The thing is though, since it's above my budget I just don't want to get caught having to pay these huge car bills for servicing and repairs.

I heard that they share the same engine as a Mini Cooper, and I know mini Cooper's around that era where shocking when it came to reliability. The thing is though the reliability does seem very average according to my research, where I just only found a few examples of them being really bad.

I am planning to take it out for a test drive this coming Saturday. I heard timing chains and fuel pumps where the main issues?

Toyota,4-Runner,"Renault grand scenic | Hi, I've been driving 2003 Nissan almera tino up until now. Had it for 6 years but I sold it now because of engine failure. I'm thinking about getting a new(er) used car. I'm looking at 2019-2020 year cars. I don't have kids but I really like minivans because of space.

Toyota,Aqua,"I just bought an old Renault Kangoo with the plan to put a bed in it and go conquer Europe! | I'm a woman with a plan! I would like to share it with you, I hope it is appropriate here!  
I have done some camping in the past, and it didn't really work out   
for me. I'm an autistic woman, and I like to travel alone with as little  
 stress as possible. Sleeping in a tent brings freedom, low costs, and   
nature- but I often did not feel safe alone, and as I'm middle aged, fat  
 and short (1.67m), sleeping on the ground on an inflatable bed was getting tougher physically. Also running to the toilet block during the   
night really got me down .  
But the dream lived on in my heart, and trough the years I looked at   
all kinds of cool camper conversions and minicampers. I figured that if I  
 got a good daily driver minivan, and fit it with a comfortable bed and a  
 mobile toilet, and a way to bring my bike with me, I can conquer all of  
 Europe!  
‚Äã  
‚Äã  
So today I took the plunge and traded my small car for a well used   
minivan, a Renault Kangoo. I folded the passenger seats down and laid   
down, and found I could comfortably lay down without even folding down   
the front seats.  The floor is almost flat.  
‚Äã  
I plan to do the following things:   
\-I need a toilet, not so sure what type is the best suited for my   
use. I may use it while camping, but I may also need it occasionally on a  
 day to day basis when on the road. Maybe something with a plastic bag   
that you can throw away after use? I'm thinking something like this to start off with. https://www.coppensrekreatie.nl/dometic-khazi-toiletemmer  
\-For the bed, I plan to buy an IKEA L√∂nset slated bed base, 70 or 80   
cm wide. From the look of it, it should be a breeze to shorten it to   
about 1.70m long, and should not be too hard to put short legs or blocks  
 under it so it sits level on the floor of the van. With a good quality   
foam mattress on it I should have a home-quality bed. It should also be   
easy to remove when not in use.  
\-I have no plans for now to camp in extreme weather or outside of official camping grounds. I plan to start off easy, and if it works out, who knows where I will end up!  
‚Äã  
For all the rest, cooking and sitting I can re-use my existing camping stuff.  
Also, this looks great to stop the daylight, and I'm a bit of a seamstress so I should be able to make this myself. https://www.busgordijn.nl/  
‚Äã  
‚Äã  
So what do you experts think? Is this a good plan? Could my idea of modifying a standard ikea bed base work? Thank you!",,,,,,,

Hi!

I just wanted  to show you my ""new"" Megane III. I found this car when I was looking for random cars on Wallapop. I wanted a Renault Megane II GT 2.0T and the Laguna III2.0T but I couldn't find a concrete unit in good/decent status.

Then I found this. A Megane III coup√©, Dynamique trim. It has the 2.0tce F4RT engine with 180hp. It had only 77500 KM when I bought it and now after three months, it has 81500 approximately. It has been serving as my daily car. I just can't be more happy with this car, I only needed to change it's belt timing system + water pump and put new tires (continental all season). It's a good successor to my old Megane II Extreme that I have sold to a very good friend when I was buying this one. Total cost between the buy operation (6800 euros) and the maintenance stuff (1200 approx.) makes me think that I have bought a very good unit.

I just want to keep it as long as I can :).

Going to show some photos of my boy. You'll see also my ex-Megane II. I miss him too! :(

Proud owner of a master mk3 from 2011 since a few months. However I only just noticed that our side door does not lock (yikes). It has been converted to a campervan. So we've only driven with it the past 3 weeks or so. Off the bat I can't see anything out of the ordinary. Online I've read this was a common issue in the mk2.

Toyota,Estima,"Sanity check on buying a Renault Wind | Hi, as I'm approaching my driving test I'm shortlisting a few potential cars and recently discovered the Renault Wind. I like its weird looks and it would happily satisfy my desire for an MX-5 until I can afford one not rusting to pieces:)

Ideally, I'd get a 2011/2012 model, my budget is ¬£2.5-3k and I'd be looking to buy from a dealer to get extra protection in case something goes wrong with the car. I'd also ask to see as much service history as possible before deciding.

Most likely I'd keep it for 2-3 years max before settling for something more sensible, but as last year was so crappy I'm in the mood for a fun car.

[Something like this example would be what I'd go for.](https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202104071095646?price-from=2000&make=RENAULT&radius=1501&price-to=3000&model=WIND&postcode=tr208ae&include-delivery-option=on&advertising-location=at_cars&sort=relevance&onesearchad=Used&onesearchad=Nearly%20New&onesearchad=New&page=1)

The average fuel economy is about 40 mpg and it's very cheap for me to insure too at just ¬£480 per year with no NCB. Road tax is ¬£170.

As I work from home I wouldn't be putting heavy miles on it, 6k is likely the maximum I'd do in a year, and realistically I'd probably only be doing 3-4k per year.



Does this sound like a good decision or stupid? Would be good to hear some thoughts and opinions, especially regarding any reliability concerns / servicing costs or what to check for when buying a convertible.

Thanks!

Edit: I've been on motorcycles for 7 years, so not overly worried about handling or having to build up confidence on the roads:) | I mean, I think you're a bit daft for considering a Renault of that era. They're not known for their reliability in terms of electronics or build quality.

I will say though that if you're happy with the car, and it suits you, then why not? You won't lose the car in the car park, it's different enough for you not to be another VAG licker, and you'll have something to enjoy the 2 days of summer we get in the UK.

I would say though that, at the price range you're at, I don't think you'll get a proper dealership selling them.

Toyota,GT86,"Is a Renault Zoe my best bet? | Hi all,

Well, it's nearly Christmas and my old banger is on its last legs. I've opted to get myself something nice for a change and I'm going for an EV.

Budget of say 17k, but the lower the better. 

I need 5 seats for the kids, body style is irrelevant and rated for 100+ miles, I don't go that far, so this range is fine for me.

I despise paying insurance and consider it a racketeering scam. So naturally the lower the insurance group the better. I'd sooner pay ¬£1000 more on a car to save ¬£100 on insurance. On principal.

It seems like a Zoe works out well for me. 5 seats, good range, about 10k and low Insurance group.

Question is: am I missing anything? I was hoping to find something like the smart forfour but like a forfive.

I also considered the Niro, soul, and combo-life. Any thoughts or advice? | My normal recommendation would be 64kwh soul/kona/e-niro, or 58kwh ID3, or Tesla 3 as these should all have \~100 mile range and avaialble ¬£10-14k price points. At ¬£17k, I'd look for a high-mileage depreciated Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6, Skoda Enyaq etcetc.

As others have noted though, if the spec is only 100 miles of range, then, an \~40kwh car will save you something. Look towards 39kwh version of any of the above (though as noted, sometimes these are not cheaper), or 40kwh Ioniq, BMW i3 or similar... a pre-2017 car will be in the old tax regime and some \~¬£170 cheaper a year for that reason. I'd skip the LEAF due to the lack of battery thermal management, just in case you do need to do a longer trip and have to charger-hop - it doesn't seem like they're any cheaper, really.

I will be grateful for any other advices in this topic. Also, any other car examples in this segment will be great! | Can't really speak for Ateca, but we have a 2020 Karoq 1.5 TSI 110kw (manual) at home (I think it's a good comparison since they're basically the same car built in the same factory) and the car is genuinely amazing. Very spacious, but still smaller than let's say an Octavia/Superb. The handling is amazing, the engine is good. It has all the benefits of an SUV (space for passengers, trunk, good sight out of driver's seat, ground clearance) while having the atributes of a regular sedan/hatchback (very comfortable to drive, the suspension feels like driving any other car, in contrast I was told cheaper SUVs tend to have body roll in corners).

Also what's great about the Karoq/Ateca platform is the fact that the car still has physical buttons on the dash, in contrast my Leon for instance has all the controls on the screen which kinda sucks when you're driving on a highway and have to look for stuff on the screen.

Toyota,Rav4,"Seat Mii 1.0 2016 first impressions | I have owned an used Mii for a week now and these are  my observations:

Positives:
+ Small but surprisingly roomy
+ Minimalistic interior
+ Still seems quality (haptic perception)
+ Has AC, remote key, electric windows (small luxuries)
+ Handles well in bigger roads and motorway speeds
+ Engine revs low at motorway speed
+ Temp, AC, fan etc controls are still physical

Negatives:
- Low back support in the seat is bad 
- Engine sounds like a tractor while driving at low revs
- First and second gear are clunky, literally
- Has not very good low rev torque
- Low ground clearance 
- 2016 model still has a radio with CD player but no Bluetooth (also, it's integrated so no swap)
- Engine would like to rev but gears are not made for it, or engine is not made for gears

Neutral:  
‚Ä¢ Long clutch travel and high take-up (normal for VW)  
‚Ä¢ Hill stop assist (not really needed)  
‚Ä¢ Gear lever is quite low. Longer handle takes space but would   bring it closer; or but it to dashboard  

Overall, it seems like a great little mini. However, I think the engine would need a bit redesign. It has quite bad low rev torque and long 1st gear exaggrates it. Also, it does not want to be in low rev area - I wonder how long it handles being revved low as it sounds like a tractor and shakes. Long hills are the second issue, torque just isn't there to keep the speed. Something like 1.5 L engine with same power would have been kinda better, but ofc space issues. 

I wish these kinda minis would be more popular among car makers. They are quite fun.  | The 2016 Seat Mii would have had the option of a Garmin Sat Nav style unit for the dashboard which then gives Bluetooth and Sat Nav, plus driving information

Toyota,Starlet,"Seat Tarraco 1.5tsi opinions | Currently in the process of looking for a new family car, just had our second child and Ford Focus / Seat Leon are no longer bigger enough.

I'm 6ft4in and with an extended rear facing seat (Axkid minikid 2) for the 2yr old behind the passenger seat in the Leon I can no longer sit in the passenger seat. Behind the driver's seat we now have baby in her Joie I-level (ISO-fix) which leaves me with barely enough room in driver's seat, reclining the I-level is a no go. I can currently manage short journeys but anything longer is very uncomfortable.

So the plan is to get rid of the Focus, as it has even less interior space, and replace with a new family car. The plan being to get a large estate, either Skoda Superb or VW Passat. 

We went looking at some yesterday and by chance also came across a Seat Tarraco, which has surprised us. I'm not a fan of SUVs, but, with seats 6 & 7 folded down as they're next to useless anyway, its got a cavernous boot (700 litres), iso fix on either side of the middle row and front passenger seat. It was bottom spec but has, surprisingly, everything you'd need (cruise control, lane assist, LED lights, digital cockpit, no sat-nav but does have Android auto). My only concern was the engine. I've had VWs 1.4 petrol in both our Leon and an A4 and it is/was great. I haven't had any experience of the newer 1.5 and in something as big as the Tarraco I'm not convinced it would be up to the job. Does any one have any experience with it or any input?

Also...we are concerned about buying a diesel Superb or Passat given the low emissions zones that seem to be popping up everywhere and risk having an unsellable/costly car in a few years time. But larger engine petrol ones seem to be like gold dust. Any thoughts on this? 

TL;DR Replacing Focus with larger car (Superb/Passat/Tarraco) but concerned about 1.5tsi engine in Tarraco and risk of buying a diesel. Thoughts? | What year is the Leon you have/drove?

Toyota,Wish,"My review of the Skoda Kamiq | As I've been watching a lot of Mat Watson car reviews (Carwow on Youtube) which I've really enjoyed, I thought I'd put down a mini review of my own of the Skoda Kamiq. 

I ended up with this car somewhat by coincidence. I moved to a new country, but as I have no income history here, I can't get a car lease from the bank before I've worked here for a while. Hence I needed to find an interim rental solution to get a car and the Skoda Kamiq was the cheapest I could find. I had driven it very briefly before via some car share apps (Bolt Drive), and didn't have the greatest impression of it as it seemed like a very basic car. Over time however it has really grown on me, and its a very practical and economical vehicle that is hard to be disappointed by (as long as you're not expecting anything from it that it's not trying to be)

**Duration driven**: about 6 weeks now

**Model**: 85kw 1.0L petrol, automatic, 2023 build, SE Drive trim (I think, not sure). This I believe: https://www.ultimatespecs.com/car-specs/Skoda/117243/2023-Skoda-Kamiq-10-TSI-115hp-DSG.html

**Things I like**:

* Driving position is quite comfortable and very practically laid out, cruise control is very easy to use as are most of the car's features. 

* Easy to manouver, despite the lack of a rear view camera. Parking sensors do their job well and the vehicle is nice and compact and easy to place. No issues getting into tight parking spots. 

* Though it lacks a sat nav, Google Maps via Android auto works very well, couldn't ask for anything more. 

* Surprisingly good at hauling stuff around. It is small, but if you put the rear seats down, I've been pleasantly surprised at how much stuff I can fit in there. 

**Things I don't like**:

* The stop start system can be a bit sluggish to respond. 

* Android auto only works via a cable, not wirelessly. 

* While the temperature control is via a button on the center console, the fan speed is controlled by going into a menu on the infotainment system. Annoying to switch between the two. 

* I think this is just a feature of the car being an economy model, but some things aren't electronic that are on many other cars now such as electric tailgates and stop start buttons vs a key. 

**Miscellaneous observations:**

* Fuel economy: did 700km on 7/8ths of a 50L tank twice, therefore equating to about 6.3L/100km based on what I estimate to be 60% out of town/highway driving and the rest in town. Use the car mostly for commuting to the office/gym/supermarket, the rest for trips out of town. Worse than what I see claimed on most websites, but not too bad. 

* The engine is small and economical, but that also means its not a great accelerator. Its fine on the motorway, just don't expect amazing performance when overtaking or accelerating from a stop. 

So in short a very nice little economical car. | Thanks for sharing. As I‚Äôve driven few Scala and Kamiq over the years I also got annoyed by the fan speed only in the infotainment but as the time passed by I realised Auto mode is quite good for heating/cooling performance.

Was thinking new/near-new as we plan to drive until it dies. Used prices still look too high. Was defaulting to Sorrento/SantaFe etc.

See that with many dealers, Skoda Kodiaqs are now 45k for a new base model with 6-7 years warranty left (ie late MY23 or MY24 with a 2024 rego date) and you can probably negotiate a bit off.  Many examples with 0-500km. And they have 2.99% financing: we could pay cash but this is a no-brainer to keep money in offset and set aside money for the balloon payment. Can get a sportline or optioned Style for 50k, although I don‚Äôt think you need any of that.

Why would I pay 15-20k more for a well-specced Rav 4 or a Santa Fe, or other examples? That‚Äôs equivalent to a massive holiday? I know Skoda depreciation is terrible but we will hold for at least a couple of years outside warranty. We will be low mileage, service on time, etc. - Skodas are considered reliable outside Australia and we are VIC so can go to a few dealers or independents if a dealer stuffs us around. Servicing is a little more but other savings like financing even that out - and I‚Äôm saving 10-20k upfront. 

I know something like a Rav 4 or even Santa Fe will last longer; but if the Skoda has 7 years of warranty life and then at least a few years with expensive repairs - it seems bizarre to spend 10-20k more on the expectation of usage in over a decade? Especially when the Skoda drives well, is big, nice interior etc 

I‚Äôd previously been brainwashed by John Cadogan about the VW Group so I feel stupid  but this seems like a good deal‚Ä¶any thoughts would be welcome! | This sounds like a great deal and,assuming you have a few dealerships to work on you will probably do even better.",,,,,,,
Volkswagen,Amarok,"Why do people rave about Skoda Octavia here? I don't get it | My company got a lease on the 2023 Octavia Estate (Style trim, 1.5 TSI, DSG) and I drove it recently on a road trip. As much as Reddit loves it, I wasn't impressed that much

Let's start with the good stuff:

* The engine and gearbox feel good
* Lots of space
* Good interior
* Good gas mileage for a non-hybrid

But tech choices and quality let me down:

* Interior rattles in many places at 5k miles
* Lane-keep assist registers false positives all the time and beeps at me for no reason
* The gauge cluster display looks cool, but I would strongly prefer HUD with regular dials instead
* Climate controls in a touchscreen (not unique to Skoda, but still a bad decision)
* The infotainment screen is a bad shape, IMO. The wide aspect ratio means that when you use CarPlay/Android Auto, controls are tiny and lots of space is wasted horizontally
* It's not the most important thing for a family car, but the driving experience is just numb. Lightest steering with no feedback, very soft suspension which causes the car to roll a lot in the bends, etc.

For context, I'm comparing it to my Ford Focus 2019 Hatch. It's not perfect either, but most annoyances from the Skoda are missing and it's a way sportier drive too

Do people who suggest Octavia all over the place not care about the negatives I found, or never actually drove it? | ‚Äògas mileage‚Äô

Is this a good buy or are there better options out there?

My wife has pretty bad anxiety with driving and has requested an automatic to help her get over it.  We also have a baby on the way and a medium sized dog.

-Isofix points for car seats.
-Reliability
-automatic
-Space for kids dogs and life -but not an estate (sorry no Superb Estate)
The car will probably get 6-7k miles a year, I'm thinking a Skoda Yeti as it ticks a lot of boxes.  Any thing I need to know about the Yeti, specific models or things to avoid? 
Also, any other recommendations for a family car that ticks those boxes?

My friend (F 72) has a previous generation Toyota Yaris that just fits in her garage and is in need of replacement.  A new Toyota Yaris will not fit in the garage.

I suggested she look at a Suzuki Ignis as an alternative.  

Does anyone have experience with the Suzuki Ignis and can provide some feedback? | We‚Äôve had a 2016 Ignis for a year. No issues, easy to drive and park, and very fuel efficient. The slightly higher ride height can be a bit more comfortable to get in and out of as well.

The ride quality can be a bit harsh over bumps, at least with the 16-inch smoked alloys. Drive slow if there‚Äôs a big speed bump coming up. The smaller steel wheeled versions might be better. Probably worth driving both the LTD and the GLX auto for comparison‚Äôs sake.

If your friend is buying new and the ride on the alloys isn‚Äôt a problem for her, the LTD seems like much smarter buying overall and for a couple of grand more you get various bits and pieces that will make life easier (privacy glass, 50:50 folding and sliding seats, keyless and push button start, guide lights for getting in and out at night etc).

If your friend is open to buying used, there are low mileage Japanese import Ignises like ours available with spec levels that put the NZ new models to shame ‚Äì including dual camera safety tech ‚Äì but they are worth getting thoroughly checked out first. Also make sure the seller/dealer doesn‚Äôt take the mickey with pricing given how cheap the NZ new models are already.

The imports also come in a ‚Äúmild hybrid‚Äù flavour that uses a small battery to run the auto stop and air conditioning and save some fuel. It‚Äôs neat and they are fine, shouldn‚Äôt be overly expensive to maintain given they are such a simple system, but I don‚Äôt think the fuel saving is worth paying extra for on its own if you‚Äôre comparing with another example. Dealers will hype up the hybrid angle but a standard model should be very economical already.

Note also that the Ignis is being dropped from the Australian market due to changing safety rules, so it‚Äôs possible its future may be uncertain in NZ too which may affect resale, if that‚Äôs a consideration.",,,,,,,

So much space and luxury, so comfortable to drive. It's more narrow than it looks and fits in my garage.

I've had mine a year and no reliability issues so far. Reliability is meant to be good and most parts are available quite easily. Replacement body panels may be harder to source. Make sure it's been under body treated as in Japan they don't use road salt like we do.

Insurance took a bit of research though I'm now with Aplan and paying not much difference than I did for a 1l Fiesta.

Volkswagen,T-Roc,"Kiezen uit Ford Focus of Toyota Auris (of anderen) | Hoi allemaal, ik ga een eerste tweedehandse auto zakelijk kopen, maar ik weet bar weinig van auto's en vind het moeilijk om een keuze te maken uit twee auto's die ik zo zal linken. Maar ik ben ook benieuwd naar wat meer algemene tips over auto's beoordelen. Dit zijn mijn voorkeuren:

* Max bedrag van 15.000 euro
* Marge auto is gewenst maar niet vereist
* Stationwagen of MPV
* Voorkeur voor hybride mbt energiezuinigheid
* Allerbelangrijkste: dat het een auto is die betrouwbaar is
* Wens: ik houd niet van allerlei schermen in de auto, dus zo min mogelijk schermen heeft mijn voorkeur, maar ook geen vereiste.

Mijn drie belangrijkste criteria zijn

1. Betrouwbaarheid
2. Energiezuinigheid
3. Ruimte

Moet ik voorzichtig zijn met een bouwjaar eerder dan bijvoorbeeld 2015 of zegt dat niks?

Ik heb in mijn zoektocht de km-stand beperkt tot 150.000. 

Ik heb twee opties in gedachten, maar sta open voor andere opties:

[Toyota Auris](https://www.autotrack.nl/a/toyota-auris-benzine-2016-56384837)

UPDATE: Dank voor de tips mensen! Hebben een financieringsaanvraag ingediend voor de Auris. Ik vond de Ford wel een betere uitstraling hebben, maar weegt niet op tegen de betrouwbaarheid

I could tell you to go underneath and check the brake lines were replaced as they say but I'm gonna guess you wouldn't know what to look for, you could maybe ask them to send you some pictures underneath because honestly the biggest worry you have with these cars at that age is corrosion.

No, you are not going to go off-roading you don‚Äôt need that truck, even if you do go off-roading you will run over a tree and puncture your gas tank, or figure out how trespassing laws work, buy a TOYOTA COROLLA. 

‚ÄúBut I can get a cheap mustang and they are known to be reliable‚Äù, yes they will reliably maul the crowd when you try to do a burnout at cars and coffee to impress a bunch of dudes and then your insurance will be even more expensive than it already is, BUY A TOYOTA COROLLA.

A early 2000‚Äôs Corolla is this. 

TL;DR BUY A   TOY-O-TA   COR-OLL-A


Edit: 

All sarcasm aside and since this is still a sub looking for advice here is some general advice for a first time car buyer or just anyone who wants solid point a to b transportation. 

Look for a Toyota Corolla, Camry, RAV4, etc. 

honda civic, accord, crv, etc. 

mazada 3, cx5, etc. 

preferably a model without a CVT And without a manual, while a manual is usually more durable than an auto, a clutch on a fwd car can be an expensive repair due to the engine and trans being packed under the hood. A buddy of mine spent $3k doing a clutch in a Nissan Versa. The car was worth 5k. 

While CVT‚Äôs get good gas mileage they are still newish on the consumer market and are prone to issues especially in Nissans, when they break you can‚Äôt repair them, you replace them. They are put into cars to get fuel economy numbers and because they are cheap. 

Yes, I know there are reliable (like Honda and Toyota) CVT‚Äôs and they are improving but true modern automatics have the track record and are going to be more reliable. (I‚Äôm sure this opinion won‚Äôt be controversial at all)

You will want to look at Facebook marketplace and Craigslist if you are in the under $5000-10,000ish range, above that price range you will want to go to a legit car dealer Eg Smith Toyota of Springfield NOT sketchy used car dealer who bought a cheap ass car at auction and didn‚Äôt fix it. 

*ALWAYS* get the pre purchase inspection when it‚Äôs a used car. You never know what you will find. 

But most it‚Äôs important to do your research on the year make and model (like people do here before they buy a 40 year old Porsche and we all tell them it‚Äôs a terrible idea) every manufacturer has its faults, even a Toyota Corolla, it‚Äôs important to know what you are getting into and what to look for. | FUCK YOU I BOUGHT A MIATA FOR OFF ROADING!!!!",,,,,,,
Volvo,960,"Toyota Corolla Hybrid, Honda Jazz Hybrid o Toyota Yaris Hybrid, o ...? | Salve a tutti,

vorrei cambiare la mia vecchia (20 anni) punto multijet.

Attualmente la macchina mi serve solo per spostamenti cittadini (provincia di Roma), serate a Roma e due tre viaggi lunghi all'anno.

Chilometraggio annuo circa 5000-6000 km.

La macchina deve essere automatica, euro 6 e ibrida poich√© l'intenzione √® di tenerla a lungo (magari altri 15-20 anni) ritardando il pi√π possibile eventuali blocchi alla circolazione.

Al momento mi sto orinetatndo verso un usato di non pi√π di 4 anni ed ho visto tre vetture:

1) toyota yaris ibrida 1.5 del 2021, 60000km a 14700‚Ç¨ (devo valutare meglio la comodit√† alla guida perch√© sono alto 1.95m)

2) honda jazz ibrida 1.5 del 2021, 50000km a 20000‚Ç¨

3) toyota corolla 1.8 ibrida del 2020, 80000km a 18500‚Ç¨

Sto evitando tutte le auto col putetech e anche i piccoli turbo benzina. Questi ultimi perch√© non sono convinto che siano in grado di lubrificare correttamente il turbo nei brevi percorsi cittadini, quindi penso che degli aspirati ibridi siano da preferire, sbaglio?

Ci sono altre vetture che dovrei considerare al di sotto di 20000‚Ç¨ ?

Vostri pareri su queste tre auto (nell'idea di un uso a lungo)?

Quei chilometraggi sono eccessivi?

Volvo,V50,"Longevity of Toyota Previa? Considering buying an old one (1991) | Hi all, I‚Äôm shopping for a new (to me) vehicle and specifically am hoping for a minivan that I can use for camping. Someone in my town is selling a 1991 Toyota Previa with 290,000 kms (not miles) on it. The guy selling it is only the second owner of the vehicle, and says he has put about $1500 into it just in parts (not including labour). 
He is asking $4,000 CAD for it but says he is flexible on price. It comes with both winter and summer tires. I live in Canada where winter tires are essential so coming with them and not having to buy new ones is a bonus. I would get it looked at by my own mechanic before buying. 
I have been hoping to buy something a bit newer and with a lot less kms than that, however the used car market is insane right now and I have always heard that ‚ÄúToyotas last forever‚Äù. I owned an old Camry for a couple of years and it was a great car. I guess I‚Äôm just wondering if the reputation of them lasting a long time is true? Any particular issues to look for?

I just got an explicative-filled private message after telling someone a Rav4 wasn't a good recommendation for someone who very clearly stated they were looking for a sedan. Unless Toyota is paying you to sell Rav4s, it's borderline concerning that you would take the time to threaten a stranger for literally saying ""they said they wanted a sedan, not an SUV"" 

Yes, for the Toyota fanboys, the Rav4 is reliable, especially compared to *some* of its competitors. However, it also is a comparatively loud, somewhat rough riding SUV that does not offer the interior comfort, warranty or amount of features that some of its competition offers. It isn't so good that it should be recommended to everyone regardless of what they actually need or are looking for. 

If someone says ""I am looking for a quiet, smooth riding sedan"" recommending a Rav4 is stupid.

I've mostly been looking at mid-2000's manual Honda Civics in an effort to avoid the automatic transmission issues common in that era, but haven't had much luck yet.

Today I test drove a 2010 VW CC Sport; maybe its just from spending so much time in Civics, but it made me miss my GTI. I know the car isn't objectively a great/sporty performer, but I loved the interior/ride and feels like it'll make my commute much more bearable.

As far as reliability, I really don't have anything to go on. The car I drove today had 125K, and didn't seem to have any issues (though I will be getting a PPI). Do these cars have a reputation for being unreliable? I know there's a premium for VW parts and a Civic is certainly going to be more reliable, but I'm ready to pull the trigger on the CC as long as it isn't likely to fall apart in my driveway.  I'm comfortable doing basic upkeep maintenance like oil / brakes / rotors and willing to learn more, but I'm out of my element as far as 'serious' engine work goes.

Edit: I am looking to keep this car 2-3 years max as I will likely be moving back to Seattle after school if that makes any difference.  | I wouldn't buy a VW with those miles on it. Why not lease another vw for 3 years? You can get a 2016 Jetta on a 36 month lease for $3k at signing and $139/month. Then they give you a 1000 visa gift card. Total cost for 3 years is $7000.

,,"I bought a 2022 Volkswagen Golf R | Hi /r/cars,

I was inspired by [/u/Hurr1canE_'s post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/xikziv/after_a_long_4_months_of_waiting_the_2023_brz_i/) from a couple days ago to post about the 2022 VW Golf R that I purchased at the end of August and give a quick review with initial thoughts.

**Buying Process**

I started looking at buying a new car after a Subaru dealership quoted me around $7k for head gasket and steering rack replacements on my 2013 WRX (which I bought new after graduating college).  It seemed irresponsible to put $7k into a nine year old car, so I started looking at what's out there.  My four requirements were: 1) manual, 2) AWD (live in MA, don't mind the MD plates, long story), 3) fun, 4) under $50k.

My requirements basically narrowed it down to WRX or the Golf R.  I'm not a big fan of the new WRX's interior (wtf is that screen??) or exterior (work in finance, didn't really want a hood scoop anymore, lol architect etc.)  That leaves the Golf R.

Hit the forums, see that there were like 400 sold in the U.S. in 2020 and 2021 combined, and only 1,200 sold to date in 2022.  K this search is gonna suck.  Call a few dealers, get quoted $10k+ markups and no delivery estimate besides ""we've received 2-3 so far in 2022, we don't expect to receive any more until 2023, we can put you on a list.""  No chance I'd get to test drive one, though I had driven the 2013 version from back when I had cross-shopped it with the WRX and loved it.  I did get to sit in a 2022 GTI w/ autobahn trim that my local dealer had in stock and fool around with the infotainment system, which all of the online reviews said was shit.  Felt super comfy, [didn't mind the infotainment](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/xikziv/after_a_long_4_months_of_waiting_the_2023_brz_i/ip7g580/), and the driving experience had been praised by literally everyone I'd seen review it, including both SavageGeese and TheTopher whose opinions I trust.  Good enough for me.

I assumed search was going to take a while, so I got a second opinion my WRX and make sure: 1) it was actually a $7k repair and 2) my car wasn't just going to explode at any moment.  Turns out it was just the throttle body boot and could be fixed for like $600 bucks.  Too late, I was already in it.  Plus, if I was going to keep the WRX I was going to need to put new tires on it, replace the brakes, and fix a dent from an errant golf ball that had hit my hood.  

I set an appointment to get the brakes and throttle body boot done assuming it would take me 1-2 years to find a Golf R at or around MSRP.  In the meantime, I figured if I needed to expand my search area, I'd look at dealers near my family in Cincinnati, OH and Annapolis, MD.  Called 20ish dealers in these markets, and dealer number 20 told me they had a customer bail on on a lapiz blue manual Golf R that morning.  Price started at MSRP + $10k.  I pulled the trigger at MSRP + $5k with the only addons being all-weather floor mats and trunk tray ($275) and a roadside assistance kit ($105).  I wasn't super psyched to pay a markup, but it was the color I wanted, it was a manual, and it would be available in ten days or less.  Plus, the salesman was super chill, straight forward, and responsive (shout out to Marco at Heritage VW in Catonsville, MD) so I didn't feel like I was going to drive eight hours from MA to MD and then get ripped off.  Plus, it brought the total cost of the car to $50k on the dot, which satisfied requirement #4 above.

Got the call that the car had been delivered a week later, drove down the following day to pick it up.  Everything was as advertised, and they matched the CarMax trade-in value for my WRX ($17k).  Took it for a test drive, loved it, bought it.  The financing was shit (5.9% with an 800+ credit rating, come on bro), but I'm refinancing at 3.25% in a few weeks with my local credit union once I get the car registered in MA.

**Initial Thoughts**

I've had the car for almost a month, and I have roughly 1,700 miles on it.  That includes 450 miles driving home from the dealer, plus another 900 driving to and from MD for a wedding.  So 350ish miles of (post break-in) spirited driving.

The car is fucking awesome.  Tons of torque all the way through the rev range, tight handling, and great ride quality in all drive modes.  The gear box is solid, though I don't like it quite as much as some other cars I've driven recently ('97 911, '23 Integra, '13 WRX).  It just feels a little plasticky / disconnected, but I think it's mostly the hollow plastic shift knob (which I plan to replace) and the fact that the gears feel a lot closer together than my WRX.  The more I've driven it, the more it's grown on me.  Also, the clutch is [SUPER light in comparison to my WRX](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/xikziv/after_a_long_4_months_of_waiting_the_2023_brz_i/ip4y7x5/), but I've gotten used to that as well.

The technology in this car has taken a lot of getting used to.  The WRX felt like it had ten year old tech in it when I bought it nine years ago, so I basically went from a car with mid-2000s tech to a car with all kinds of cool shit (adaptive cruise control, drive modes, tons of adjustable settings), but no buttons.  You can see my link on infotainment above for more info, but all-in-all it's been awesome now that I've gotten comfortable with all of the features.  Everything I'd ever need to do while driving can be done in 2-3 ""button"" presses.  In my opinion, car reviewers were harder on the infotainment than they should have been, but we will see if it gets laggy when I'm trying to cold start it in a MA winter.

The drive modes are super fun.  Comfort is perfect for commuting on crappy New England roads, and Nurburgring mode is a fucking blast in the twisties.  I'm still fine-tuning my custom drive mode, but I'm settling on everything in ""go fast"" settings except for the suspension, which I've left in Comfort.  One cool thing about the car is you can actually tune the suspension setting to be softer than the default Comfort setting and tighter than the default Race setting.  Just so many options.

**Conclusion**

All-in-all, I took a leap on a car that I had never actually driven before, and I have absolutely no regrets.  If you're interested in this car and can find it at a reasonable price, buy one.  You won't be disappointed.

[I owe you guys some pictures.](https://imgur.com/a/IKvsKGa)  I took these earlier today after after getting it ceramic coated (Opti-Coat Pro Plus) and tinted (35% max legal in MA).  Shout out to Shawn and Lia at Craft Detailing in Woburn/Dedham, MA for doing a great job.

TL;DR: I spent $50k on a VW Golf.  Love it.  I'll be around until 12AM eastern time tonight and most of the day tomorrow to chat and answer questions. | Personally I wouldn‚Äôt give a shout out to a dealer that rinsed me for $5k over msrp just because they can. We can‚Äôt normalize this crooked crap.",,,,,,,
,,"Large compilation of 40-80 MPH acceleration times | Being frustrated by the abundance of 0-60 and 1/4 mile times led me to compile a list of 40-80 MPH times, which are more indicative of real-world acceleration (such as when overtaking). All of the figures are from my own collection of printed Car & Driver and Motortrend magazines. I simply subtracted the published 0-40 time from the 0-80, as performed during the same quarter-mile run. The biggest shortcoming is that I stupidly didn't denote manual or automatic transmissions.

,,"Volkswagen Jetta trash car??  | 
Hi there,

I am looking to buy my first car, and I am very torn between a Jetta and a Fusion. I like the Jetta better as it seems more stylish etc, but I have heard mixed reviews on their reliability. When it comes down to it, I really want a car that will last well for several years. I am looking at 2016-2020 for the Fusions and 2019-2020 for the Jettas. Any advice is greatly appreciated!! 

üëâ My budget is 10k cash and I want something under 120,000 miles.  | Try to find a 2.5 5 cyl model, or a ‚Äú2.slow‚Äù (naturally aspirated *non-turbo* 4 cylinder). Those are pretty reliable and you can easily find one under $10k. 

If you somehow find a 2019-2020 Jetta for $10k it‚Äôs gonna be clapped out trash. VW also took what was a fairly reliable 1.4 turbo (sourced from Europe) and bored it out a whole .1 liter. Whatever they did, the 1.5L used currently is not as reliable as the predecessor.",,,,,,,
,,"I was wrong about Volkswagen. I love the Passat. Are they reliable? | UPDATE: Car broke down this morning. Epc light and shaking üòÖ. Rental company will tow it and give me a new one. 

Tldr: volkswagen cost of ownership/maintenance compared to owning a japanese car?

Post is all over. Rant, options, questions etc.

I aways assumed Volkswagen was kinda pointless. My assumptions were this...not as nice as an audi or merc, not as good performance as a bmw, not as reliable as a lexus/acura, not as fast as an Infiniti. But then with all that it's a German car so must cost more to fix and maintain than the Japanese sedans. 

I just never saw the point in buying a Volkswagen. 

I got a 2020 Passat as a rental. I love this car. It's deceivingly gigantic inside, visibility is great and reminiscent of a 90's/early 00's car, it's got a lot less power than I'm used to but it's enough and very responsive, it's comfortable. The interior is a perfect blend of simplicity and common sense design where it matters. Of course the first google search tells me it's being discontinued? But that's okay, I buy used anyway. 

Now for the big question. How reliable are these cars, and volkswagen in general? And how much does maintenance cost? Also can any mechanic work on them or do they gotta go to a german vehicle mechanic? 

I've always steered clear of german cars and turbo vehicles for this reason as cost of ownership is a big deal for me. I currently drive an Infiniti G37x that has needed under $1k in repairs over 13 years and has never broken down before. I avoid the dealer like the plague and take it to a regular mechanic. The last thing I want is a costly vehicle. | I have a golf and I wana say i am very honest about them.
are they as reliable as toyota or lexus ? No but you get better ride and options.

different in part prices with Toyota and lexus is not that much in common parts but in engine , transmission , turbo ,haldex cost yes ther are more expensive than Toyota or lexus.


with all these being said, after having my R with all its problems i cant see my self going back to drive toyota (camry to be specific ).



if you buy it you need to be patient and know a very good garage that can soruce good used parts. additionally do the maintenance on time. Oil change no later than 5k kilometers.
make sure small parts to be changed. for example my R has a small part in the fuel line i think its called camshaft follower and that nobody told me to change and it is small part but it could brick the engine.


in conclusion , good garage , maintenance and some savings for rainy day.",,,,,,,
,,"2013 VW Passat 2.5L vs 2013 VW CC 2.0T | I‚Äôm trying to decide what‚Äôs the better of these two. The mileage is relatively the same for both. They both have minor damage.

We just needed something we could afford with plenty of space since we housesit fulltime and basically need to do a mini move every month or so (luggage pieces, computer stair, all our crap). Maybe there are other car models that are actually better or would be more reliable?

* **Price:** $31,890
* **Mileage:** 34,016km 

Does anyone here have experience with this model? Anything we should watch out for in terms of reliability, maintenance costs, or common issues? From what I can understand, we should be asking for the maintenance records before we go ahead with this? (Is it obvious if they are bad, btw? Sorry if that's a stupid question)

 | The interior looks to be in perfect condition, which would explain the asking price.

It's an old car and you cant look inside, ask for a test ride, maybe bring someone with mechanical knowledge that can look/listen for any defects.

My guess based on the optical condition of the car would be that this is an well kept enthusiasts car, so there shouldn't be much wrong with it.",,,,,,,
,,"Comprei um Volvo 960 3.0 1996/97 | Comprei um Volvo 960 s√≥ pra dar aquela agitada na minha vida hehe

**Uma historinha pra quem se interessar:**  
A cerca de um ano atr√°s eu estava buscando algum carro legal que n√£o fosse apenas um carro pra me levar para os lugares, mas que me desse prazer em o dirigir e que tamb√©m tivesse personalidade, coisa que o meu celtinha n√£o podia me proporcionar. Comecei vendo carros mais novos, e embora alguns modelos me chamassem aten√ß√£o, seus valores eram um pouco desanimadores, e tamb√©m n√£o tinham muita personalidade. Comecei a explorar alguns modelos mais antigos e acabei me deparando com alguns modelos de volvo. Eu j√° tinha certa admira√ß√£o pela marca, mas nunca tinha me aprofundado em sua hist√≥ria, e foi ai que eu me perdi. Comecei a ver reviews dos carros, estudando a evolu√ß√£o dos modelos e criei um certo apego por eles.

Logo de cara me apaixonei pelos volvos da s√©rie 240, suas linhas e curvas s√£o muito lindas em minha opini√£o, por√©m tem um pequeno problema ai: quase imposs√≠vel de achar no Brasil, e mesmo se achasse eu imagino que seria uma fortuna. O modelo que me veio em seguida foi os 850 que s√£o inclusive ic√¥nicos pra marca na sua varia√ß√£o wagon, e l√° fui eu buscar nos classificados alguns pra dar uma olhada pessoalmente. Passei uma semana mandando mensagens para algumas pessoas combinando hor√°rio e consegui marcar pra ver um 460, um 850 e tamb√©m um 960 que me pareceu similar mas at√© ent√£o eu n√£o tinha pesquisado muito sobre.

Eu at√© ai n√£o sabia muito o que esperar vendo eles pessoalmente, j√° que eu achava carros antigos bonitos, mas nunca me imaginei dirigindo um j√° que eu gostava de carros firminhos, com suas modernidades e tal, e a maioria dos carros antigos me agradavam no visual externo, mas n√£o internamente. Mesmo assim, por hype tamb√©m de meus amigos, partimos viagem pra pelo menos ver esses carros e saber como eram pessoalmente.

O 960 foi o primeiro que fomos ver, chegamos na casa do dono, e conforme fui me aproximando do carro na garagem fui me dando conta do tamanho que aquele carro tinha, abri a porta do motorista, aquele som da trava da porta abrindo como se fosse nova, me sentei naquele banco que tem o conforto de um sof√° e ainda com ajustes el√©tricos, os bot√µes do painel ainda com a tinta dos desenhos e fazendo aquele click robusto e t√°til, teto solar que eu nunca havia brincado na vida, aquela sensa√ß√£o de seguran√ßa de estar em um carro grande e s√≥lido... enfim acho que deu pra entender que eu achei o carro o m√°ximo. E ent√£o chegou a hora de abrir o cap√¥ pra ver a estrela do show. Eu nunca havia visto um motor com mais de 4 cilindros pessoalmente, e aquele motor de 6 cilindros em linha me pegou totalmente desprevenido, ele era assustador, e o cap√¥ obviamente gigante para acomodar a crian√ßa.  
Eu fiquei sinceramente impressionado com o carro, n√£o pensei que pudesse ser t√£o emocionante ver um desse pessoalmente. J√° saindo da casa dele eu sabia que os outros carros que a gente iria ver n√£o seriam do mesmo jeito, j√° que os 960 eram os de n√≠vel mais alto na √©poca, e por foto j√° dava pra ver a diferen√ßa se comparando com os outros.

Resumidamente, a gente conseguiu ver o 460, e realmente estava longe do n√≠vel do 960, e o dono do 850 acabou furando com a gente, ent√£o at√© hoje n√£o sei como √© um ao vivo. Como eu disse no inicio, isso foi a um ano atr√°s, e eu fui mais pra ver como eram os carros, mas j√° sabia que eles no Brasil eram complicados de se manter. O dono do 960 estava pedindo um valor que eu n√£o achava interessante, e somado ao fato de eu n√£o estar t√£o bem economicamente naquele momento, acabei deixando tudo de lado. A ideia de ter um volvo 960 permaneceu na minha cabe√ßa, mas como um sonho imagin√°rio e n√£o como uma poss√≠vel realidade.

...Avan√ßando no tempo para 2 semanas atr√°s, eu estando agora mais tranquilo na vida, bem economicamente, recebi uma notifica√ß√£o autom√°tica do marketplace informando que o valor do volvo tinha sido reduzido. Me veio a tona novamente a experi√™ncia que foi ver aquele carro a um ano atr√°s, e dessa vez o cora√ß√£o falou mais alto.

,,"Does anyone Have a Volvo C70? | I'm a loyal SAAB driver. Eventually, I would like try VOLVO. I'm curious what the opinion is on these cars? and just Volvo in general?   | The C70 is a solid convertible coupe. Here in America, from 2006 till 2013 they're only sold in the ""T5"" variant which is a 5cylinder turbo motor, it's a good thing too, considering Volvo's 5cyl engine is one of the most robust and reliable they've ever made. If you want to DIY a lot of the basic repairs/maintenance with these cars C70 or otherwise, you'll be able to do so with relative ease. These cars are (mostly) assembled in a logical format with service in mind so, doing most things are easy breezy. My recommendation is to buy one with service records if you can help itand *only* use full synthetic engine oil because of the turbocharger. Use Premium 91 octane or better fuel and you'll be in great shape. One of the most pricey jobs to do on these cars is the PCV/Oil trap so, make sure it's been done or had a long history of regular oil changes. If you don't want to do your own maintenance, dealership and independent shop network is spread pretty good across the US and Europe. 

Volvo, in general, has a great community. There are assholes here and there because we live on planet earth and that's how it is but by and large, the folks in our community and very helpful and informative. Whether you get a newer Volvo like me, I have an '06 or you get a 1970's or '80's model, there's s group out there to help support you. Brand perception ranges depending on who you ask. If you ask me, I'll tell you that Volvo is an understated euro luxury brand with excellent value for the money. Many standard features aren't even options on many cars out there and generally, the build quality both inside and out is high. I don't ever see myself buying anything else that isn't a Volvo when it comes to a car for myself or my family. Brand loyalty runs fairly strong in our group too, not everyone, but a lot of people feel this way.

Now, maybe you can provide me with some info too! Why have you been so loyal to Saab and what is it about them? Feel free to be as detailed as you like, I'll read it all! And ask me anything, I'll do my best to give you a good answer. Tusen takk!",,,,,,,
,,"What‚Äôs the v60 cross country like? | I‚Äôm in Canada, very limited wagon availability up here. I‚Äôve got a pickup truck with a big payment and a Mini Cooper with a medium payment. Truck has a few more years, mini is done its term end of 2024 but it was a balloon payment. It‚Äôs worth a bit more than I owe, but I won‚Äôt have much trade in.

I live rural and have two kids under two. It‚Äôs a cooper countryman, and the hatch is handy, but it just doesn‚Äôt fit two car seats and a tall driver. I work from home mostly, but commute 200km round trip twice a week.

I love the polestar v60 but after having owned a few sports-adjacent cars, I‚Äôve realized it‚Äôs a waste for me. I don‚Äôt need a fast car when I only drive a few km over the speed limit. 

I‚Äôm expecting rates to come down as 2024 progresses and I‚Äôm hoping to buy something around the summer and get rid of the mini.

The v60 seems to be more in the price than the v90. I‚Äôd prefer the old wagon version, but the cross country is more common up here.

Wondering on the longevity of these cars? 

My biggest gripe on the mini is how proprietary it is. Needed new wipers last week. Went to three spots and no one had them. Had to get them from the dealership. 100 bucks and over an hour away.

Needed brakes. My tire guy and mechanic couldn‚Äôt do it because their computer couldn‚Äôt work on the bmw stuff etc.

There‚Äôs no Volvo dealer here either, also an hour away. But are they as much of a headache as the German stuff? 

What‚Äôs the v60 like to live with? How is it in tight parking lots? I love the aesthetic.

Also, any years to avoid? Might get new, but also open to a 21-22 with low miles if it‚Äôs a good deal. | I've leased two V60CCs (2015 and 2018), as well as a 2018 V90CC and now a 2024 V60 Polestar Engineered (and coincidentally, a Mini Countryman S) and I would drive any of the Volvos again. The V60 is just such a perfect daily driver, capable for handling cargo, and massively comfy for long distances (I took the 2015 Cross Country literally on a cross country road trip). The V90CC is unmatched for looks (and not much bigger than the 60), and the V60PE is both crazy fast and very practical (I've had it since August and filled the gas tank twice...city driving though).

,,"Volvo V40, is it worth it? | Hi guys,

So I'm currently in the market for a new car, most likely a hatchback for now, and I'm mostly interested in Volvos based on what I've come across in terms of safety and reliability, but also because I really like volvo designs.

So I'm currently looking at V40s, preferably petrol as I sometimes drive to Birmingham and would like to avoid ULEZ taxes. I'm also in between when it comes to whether i should go for a manual or automatic transmission. I've been driving manual so far but i feel like I would like to get an auto, although reliability is my main priority.

I'm ofcourse looking to buy a used volvo, my budget being up to ¬£11,000. I already went to the tradecentreuk today just so I could see one in person, but I'm really on the edge now.

I don't mind putting money into it over a few years, as long as the engine and gear box will be good. He says he has service history, just checking if its full/what extent the history goes back to.  Its up for ¬£1.7k.

2020 v60t6 inscription, 4 years 111000km I've done the brakes once, regular oil changes (16k km) I push mine to 24k km because of the supperior oil, changed the front wiper blades once.

I put 94 octane in it and beat the piss out of it, I also put 94 in every gas powered tool/toy that I have.
